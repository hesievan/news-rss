										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Do you want to live longer?</h2>
<p>If you’re like most people, your answer is probably, “Yes!”</p>
<p>And, you probably want to live not only a longer life, but also a healthier one.</p>
<p>If so, you don’t have to look very far to find claims about how to improve—no, “<em>optimize</em>”—your health.</p>
<p>Want to reverse chronic disease? Extend that youthful glow? Live to 115… or forever? Lots of fitness influencers, authors, and podcasters will tell you how to do it.</p>

<p>And just how much effort, time, and money do these methods really require?</p>
<p>Most of all: <strong>Are the benefits worth the trade-offs?</strong></p>
<p>In this infographic, we’ll explore.</p>
<p>By the end of it, you’ll have clarity about how to get the health and longevity you want, while living a life you enjoy.</p>

<p>There’s just one problem: <strong>Common longevity advice seems to involve an extraordinary amount of effort. And time. And money. And complexity. </strong></p>
<p>Is all the effort necessary? Is it worth it?</p>
<p>And, will it even work?</p>

<h2 id="myths">The myths—and realities—of “optimizing” your health</h2>
<p>Health and longevity advice is everywhere these days: podcasts, books, social media, that guy at the gym…</p>
<p>Plus, influential “figureheads” have given the movement outsized attention. Think: popular podcasters and health experts Dr. Peter Attia, Dr. Andrew Huberman, and Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and biohacker Bryan Johnson.</p>
<p>We understand the appeal of this kind of content. Who doesn’t want a longer, healthier life? (Not to mention the comforting sense of control that can come from designing and executing a “perfect” health plan.)</p>
<p>But for us at PN, where we’ve collectively coached hundreds of thousands of people with real human lives, we know that “optimal” is rarely realistic.</p>
<p>Not only that, <em>optimal isn’t necessary</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Making modest, relatively consistent efforts towards health and well-being will likely give you better results than following an intense, highly “optimized” protocol. </strong></p>
<p>If that sounds hard to believe, we get it. So let’s explore that bold statement, starting with the biggest myths surrounding longevity and health optimization.</p>
<h3>Myth: The “basics” aren’t enough.</h3>
<p>There’s an idea that getting and staying healthy must require a set of complex, “cutting edge” strategies—especially if your goal is to outlive the average American.</p>
<p><strong>In reality, the “basics” work really, <em>really</em> well.</strong> (These are things like exercising regularly; eating a nutrient-rich diet; getting adequate sleep; managing stress; and staying socially connected. We’ll discuss these more later.)</p>
<p>Only, very few people <em>do</em> the basics consistently.</p>
<p>The real reason more people aren’t living as long, or as well, as they could be <em>isn’t </em>because they’re not taking ice baths or getting vitamin C infusions…</p>
<p>It’s because they’re not doing the (relatively) simple stuff, consistently.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re really, truly doing a well-rounded set of health-promoting behaviors with 80-90 percent consistency, you’re probably already close to peak optimization.</strong></p>
<h3>Myth: More is better</h3>
<p>If a handful of basic behaviors get results, then doing them <em>perfectly</em> and <em>as much as possible</em> will help you get, and stay, even healthier—right?</p>
<p>Not so fast. There’s a law of diminishing returns when it comes to health and fitness efforts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147912" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/07/effortlongevitygraph_r2.png" alt="Graph shows that with small amounts of health effort, longevity can improve a lot, but as those efforts increase, longevity benefits plateau" width="1024" height="892" /></p>
<p>Plus, in our experience, doing too many things or adding in too much complexity to your health and fitness regime can:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li><strong>Add risk factors </strong>that could actually make your health and fitness worse (such as chronic injuries or burnout due to overtraining, and/or nutrient deficiencies or disordered eating due to an over-preoccupation with &#8220;clean&#8221; or restrictive eating).</li>
<li><strong>Make it harder for you to sustain good habits. </strong>People who take on too much are more likely to burn out. Research shows people who try to accomplish multiple goals are <em>less committed </em>and <em>less likely to succeed</em> than those focused on a single goal.<sup>1</sup></li>
<li><strong>Make your life less enjoyable, which in turn compromises health.</strong> Striving to maximize physical health can interfere with mental, emotional, and social well-being, which plays an essential role in healthspan and lifespan. (One study showed people with high levels of happiness and life satisfaction lived up to 10 years longer than people with low levels.<sup>2</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<p>And what’s the point of living longer if you’re not living a full, well-rounded, <em>enjoyable</em> life? While some effort is definitely important, past a certain point, more isn’t <em>necessarily</em> better.</p>
<h3>Myth: Cutting-edge strategies offer significant benefits.</h3>
<p>Let’s say you <em>could</em> put all those advanced, complex strategies into action without sacrificing consistency or life enjoyment, or compromising your overall well-being.</p>
<p>They’d have to pay off, wouldn’t they?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>Much of the research on longevity optimization (so far) is either in mice, is observational, is theoretical, or has been tested on very small numbers of people for very short periods of time. </strong></p>
<p>In fact, many of the fringe methods and supplements touted by influencers or biohackers are not only unproven but even potentially unsafe.<sup>3 4 5 6</sup></p>
<p>Point being: Put your efforts towards foundational health behaviors with proven track records (the kind we’ll cover in this article) before you invest in fringe efforts.</p>
<h3>Myth: It’s all or nothing.</h3>
<p>You might think, “Well, I’m not getting out of bed at 5 a.m. five times a week to go running for 60 to 90 minutes to optimize my VO₂ max, so I may as well just accept I’m not going to be a healthy person.”</p>
<p>Some folks feel overwhelmed by the idea of optimizing their health, so they figure they might as well do nothing.</p>
<p>However, <strong>our internal data shows that you can be far from “perfect” to get results.</strong></p>
<p>In our year long PN Coaching program, even clients who practiced their (basic) habits <em>less than half </em>of the time got measurable results.</p>

<h3>Don’t let optimization culture convince you great health is beyond your capabilities.</h3>
<p>Instead, we encourage you to…</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li><strong>Consider your options. </strong>Review the facts, and get a clear understanding of which behaviors are most likely to give you the best bang for your buck.</li>
<li><strong>Get clear on the tradeoffs.</strong> Decide which things you are, and aren’t willing to commit to.</li>
<li><strong>Make decisions that align with your goals.</strong> Including what kind of lifestyle you want, and how you want to spend your time and dollars.</li>

<p>Keep reading and we’ll guide you through it.</p>
<h2 id="costs">The benefits—and tradeoffs—of a healthy lifestyle</h2>
<p>Putting effort towards your health is great. But efforts come with tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at both the efforts, and the tradeoffs, to achieve the health you want for yourself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147908" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/07/cost-of-optimization-continuum-r2.png" alt="Large image shows six categories of health levels: coasting, light effort, medium, high, very high, and extreme.

<h2 id="whats-required">A deeper look: The most effective health behaviors (and their optimal dose)</h2>
<p>If you want to reduce your risk of chronic disease, and generally stay healthier for longer, what should you do?</p>
<p>As we said earlier, the issue isn’t that we need some highly detailed, cutting-edge protocol. The basics work. The issue is that most people don’t do them.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the image below, most people don’t get enough fruits and veggies, sleep, or exercise. And the number of people who do all these things on a regular basis (while also avoiding tobacco and minimizing alcohol) is extremely low: likely a fraction of a percent.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147915" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/FundamentalHealthBehaviors_v4.png" alt="Graph shows only 10 percent of people eat 5 servings of fruits and veggies daily; 15 percent sleep 7 to 9 hours a night’ 24 percent get recommended weekly aerobic and resistance exercise; 71 percent drink moderately or less; and 89 percent don’t smoke" width="1024" height="826" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/FundamentalHealthBehaviors_v4.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/FundamentalHealthBehaviors_v4-300x242.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/FundamentalHealthBehaviors_v4-768x620.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/FundamentalHealthBehaviors_v4-94x76.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/FundamentalHealthBehaviors_v4-295x238.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Finally, let’s take a closer look at what these basics are, and the “sweet spot” of effort versus reward.</p>
<h3>Foundational Health Behavior #1: Exercise regularly</h3>
<p>All health experts agree: Moving your body is important.</p>
<p>Yes, exercise will help you stay lean, and improve mood, energy, and function, but it will also help you stay alive (and healthier) for longer.</p>
<p>In fact, a study of Harvard alumni found that <em>any</em> amount of physical activity reduces the risk of death from any cause. <strong>Exercise extended lifespan regardless of body weight, blood pressure, smoking habits, or genetic predisposition.</strong><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Another study of 272,550 older adults found engaging in even low amounts of physical activity significantly decreased risk of death from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and all causes.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Specifically, steep risk declines happened when accumulating at least 7.5 MET-hours* of activity per week. The greatest increase in benefits came from achieving 7.5 to 15 MET hours. Increasing activity beyond that further decreases risk, but at a continually lower rate, as the graph below shows.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147917" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/MET_Graph.png" alt="Graph show that cancer mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality all decrease as exercise increases, with the greatest increase in benefits from achieving 7.5 to 15 MET hours of exercise per week" width="1024" height="547" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/MET_Graph.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/MET_Graph-300x160.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/MET_Graph-768x410.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/MET_Graph-94x50.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/MET_Graph-295x158.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>*MET-hours (Metabolic Equivalent Hours) measures the energy cost of activity, based on duration and intensity. Some examples: 2 hours of resting = ~2 MET-hours; 2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity = ~8 MET-hours; 2 hours of moderate resistance training = ~7 MET-hours.</p>
<p>Increasing the intensity of exercise is an efficient way to rack up MET-hours, but plain old walking counts too: In a study of 28,000 adults, <strong>every 1,000 daily step increase was associated with a 12 percent lower risk of death</strong>. (This association began at 2,500 steps and continued up to 17,000 steps.)<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>(Cool factoid: For folks concerned with dementia in particular, one study showed that getting just 3,826 steps per day was associated with a 25 percent reduced risk of dementia—and getting 9,826 steps per day was associated with a 50 percent lower risk!<sup>10</sup>)</p>
<p><strong>Ideally, cardiovascular activity is paired with resistance or weight-bearing exercise.</strong></p>
<p>Resistance training supports health and longevity in various ways: it can help preserve valuable muscle mass, maintain mental sharpness, improve odds of surviving cancer, support metabolic health, and generally help you stay alive.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Among older adults especially, falls are a leading cause of death.<sup>12</sup> Resistance training can both prevent the risk of falls&#8211;because of improved balance and muscle stability<sup>13</sup>—as well as reduce the risk of serious injury&#8211;because of better bone density.<sup>14<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147914" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseImprovesHealth.png" alt="Image shows how resistance training and aerobic training benefit numerous areas of health, such as cognitive function, blood sugar regulation, mobility, and more." width="1024" height="1196" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseImprovesHealth.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseImprovesHealth-257x300.png 257w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseImprovesHealth-877x1024.png 877w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseImprovesHealth-768x897.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseImprovesHealth-94x110.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseImprovesHealth-295x345.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></sup></p>
<p>A sedentary lifestyle does the opposite, increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer (breast, colon, colorectal, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancer), and all-cause mortality.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>In fact, two decades of sedentary lifestyle is associated with twice the risk of premature death compared to being physically active.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How much exercise should you do?</strong></p>
<p>Standard exercise recommendations suggest:<sup>17</sup></p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity (or some combination of both), <em>plus</em></li>
<li>2 sessions per week of resistance training, targeting most major muscle groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting up to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or some mix of both) <em>as well as</em> three resistance training sessions per week provides further benefits.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people getting enough exercise? </strong></p>
<p>Most people are not.</p>
<p>Only 24 percent meet the recommendations for <em>both</em> aerobic and resistance exercise. And fewer than 47 percent of American adults meet recommendations for aerobic physical activity.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is getting more than the recommended amount better?</strong></p>
<p>For the most part yes, but past a certain point, more effort delivers less benefit—and potentially more risk.</p>
<p><strong>Overtraining </strong>(and/or under-recovering) can disrupt hormone levels, mess with sleep and mood, cause excess fatigue, chronically elevate your heart rate, cause injuries, and more.<sup>18 19</sup> Extreme volumes of endurance exercise training may be detrimental for the heart, and increase risk of myocardial fibrosis, coronary artery calcification, and atrial fibrillation.<sup>20 21 22 23</sup></p>
<p>So, the benefits of exercise exist on a U-shaped curve. (This is known as the <strong>“Extreme Exercise Hypothesis,</strong>”<sup>24</sup> as seen in the image below.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147913" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseHypothesisGraph_v5.png" alt="Graph shows a u-shaped curve where health risks are highest when exercise is either very low or extremely high, with the least risks at moderate or high exercise." width="1024" height="875" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseHypothesisGraph_v5.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseHypothesisGraph_v5-300x256.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseHypothesisGraph_v5-768x656.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseHypothesisGraph_v5-94x80.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ExerciseHypothesisGraph_v5-295x252.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>A “high” amount of exercise is good for you, but the “highest” amount possible probably isn’t. (Health benefits likely max out around 7-10 hours of cardio, and 3-4 resistance training sessions per week.)</p>
<p>We like what one study concluded: <strong>“If the mantra ‘exercise is medicine’ is embraced, underdosing <em>and</em> overdosing are possible.”</strong><sup>25</sup></p>
<h3>Foundational Health Behavior #2: Eat a nourishing, nutrient-rich diet</h3>
<p>Eating well doesn’t have to be complicated. There are a few key elements to nail down, and the rest is up to your own personal preferences and needs.</p>
<p>We suggest focusing on three nutrition fundamentals.</p>
<h4>Nutritional key #1: Eat more whole and minimally-processed foods</h4>
<p>Whole and minimally-processed foods are naturally nutrient rich—complete with fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals—and far less calorie-dense than highly- or ultra-processed foods (UPFs). They also have less sugar, sodium, and trans fats—the latter which is directly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, complications during pregnancy, colon cancer, diabetes, obesity, and allergy.<sup>26 27 28</sup></p>
<p>These qualities contribute to their many health benefits; Diets rich in whole or minimally-processed foods are associated with lower rates of depression,<sup>29 30 31</sup> heart disease,<sup>32</sup> type 2 diabetes,<sup>33</sup> cancer,<sup>34</sup> and improved longevity.<sup>35</sup></p>
<p>The largest study on processed foods—which included almost 10 million participants—found UPFs are linked to 32 harmful effects, including type 2 diabetes, mental health disorders, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality.<sup>36</sup></p>
<p>Another study found that a higher consumption of ultra-processed foods (four or more servings daily) was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of all-cause mortality. (For each additional serving of ultra-processed food, all-cause mortality increased by 18 percent.)<sup>37</sup></p>
<p>Not that you need to be plucking tomatoes straight off the vine.</p>
<p><strong>Eating a minimally processed food diet is more about overall dietary patterns—and moving along the continuum of improvement—rather than rigidly avoiding all forms of processing.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147918" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ProcessFoodsGraph.png" alt="Illustrated table shows various foods types and their whole, minimally processed, or ultra-processed options. All foods exist on this continuum between whole and ultra-processed." width="1024" height="1383" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ProcessFoodsGraph.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ProcessFoodsGraph-222x300.png 222w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ProcessFoodsGraph-758x1024.png 758w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ProcessFoodsGraph-768x1037.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ProcessFoodsGraph-89x120.png 89w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/ProcessFoodsGraph-295x398.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How many minimally-processed foods should you eat?</strong></p>
<p>There currently aren’t any formal guidelines for the amount of minimally-processed foods to eat. In our experience coaching over 100,000 clients, we find people are most satisfied, and get significant health improvements, when 70 to 80 percent of their diet comes from whole or minimally-processed foods.</p>
<p>Any improvement counts though. If you’re currently eating very few whole and minimally processed foods, getting at least 50 percent of your diet from these foods would make a big difference to your health, energy, and longevity.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people eating enough minimally-processed foods?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Recent US data shows that Americans get about 28.5 percent of their calories from whole or minimally-processed foods, and 56 percent of their calories from highly- or ultra-processed foods.<sup>38</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is getting more than the recommended amount better?</strong></p>
<p>Not beyond a certain point.</p>
<p>If you <em>want</em> to, consuming up to 90 percent of calories from minimally-processed foods will truly maximize your benefits, but beyond that there are likely no further benefits.</p>
<p>Besides, some processed foods enhance health rather than detract from it. Think about the protein powder that helps you meet your protein requirements, the commercial salad dressing that helps you eat your vegetables, or the weekly brownie à la mode you share with your grandkid that brings joy to both of your lives.</p>
<p>(Read more: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/minimally-processed-foods ">What you should know about minimally-processed foods vs. highly-processed foods</a>)</p>
<h4>Nutritional key #2: Eat five fruits and vegetables</h4>
<p>You’ve heard it a million times. We’ll be the nag and say it again: Eat your fruits and veggies.</p>
<p>A massive study involving over 1.8 million people showed that eating more fruits and vegetables was significantly associated with a decreased risk of death—with the benefits plateauing at five servings a day. <strong>People who ate five servings a day had a 13 percent lower risk of death from any cause compared to people who ate two servings per day.</strong><sup>39</sup></p>
<p>Additionally, the consumption of fruits and vegetables <em>very likely </em>reduces the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke; <em>probably</em> reduces the risk of cancer; and <em>possibly</em> prevents weight gain.<sup>40</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How many fruits and vegetables should you eat?</strong></p>
<p>A healthy target is five fist-sized servings of fruits and vegetables daily. (Generally, we recommend dividing that into three servings of veggies and two servings of fruit.)</p>
<p>For bonus points, try to eat a variety of colors.</p>
<p>The pigments in fruits and veggies come from various healthful nutrients (called phytochemicals or phytonutrients). Different colors mean different phytochemicals, giving you a diverse array of these beneficial compounds, which are likely responsible for a majority of the health benefits of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>(Read more: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/color-chart">What the colors of fruits and vegetables mean</a>)</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people eating enough fruits and vegetables?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Americans only eat an average of 2.5 servings of produce (fruit and vegetables combined) per day.<sup>41</sup></p>
<p>Only 12.2 percent of people meet fruit intake recommendations, and less—9.3 percent—meet vegetable intake recommendations.</p>
<p>A mere ten percent of Americans get a full five servings of fruits and vegetables combined per day.<sup>42</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is getting more than the recommended amount better?</strong></p>
<p>There are likely diminishing returns to eating more than the above suggestions.</p>
<p>In that massive study mentioned earlier that observed 1.8 million people, the life-extending benefits of fruits and veggies plateaued at five servings per day.<sup>39</sup></p>
<p>In other words, higher intake (beyond two servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables) was not associated with additional disease risk reduction.</p>
<p>That said, there may be other benefits to eating more fruits and vegetables. For example, due to their fiber and water content, fruits and vegetables are filling yet low in calories, so they can support weight management—and they certainly aren’t going to harm your health.</p>
<h4>Nutritional key #3: Eat enough protein</h4>
<p>Protein is the most important macronutrient to get right, especially as we age.</p>
<p>Plant protein in particular is linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and death from all causes.<sup>43 44 45</sup></p>
<p>In terms of animal proteins, the results are more mixed. (That said, research on protein intake and mortality is generally based on observational studies that don&#8217;t give us clear ideas about cause and effect.) Generally, minimally processed forms of fish, poultry, and low-fat dairy are the best animal protein sources.</p>
<p>To minimize health risks such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, limit processed forms of red meat (like bacon, hot dogs, deli slices, and pepperoni sticks). Even <em>un</em>processed forms of red meat should likely be limited to about 18 oz (~4 to 5 palm-sized portions) or less per week.<sup>46 47 48</sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, regardless of the source, getting sufficient protein—at least 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight—significantly reduces the risk for sarcopenia (muscle loss), frailty, and neuromuscular decline.<sup>49 50</sup></p>
<p>Protein is also vital for maintaining and building muscle, keeping bones and soft tissues healthy, supporting immunity, and more. It’s also the most satiating macronutrient, and thus helpful for fat loss and/or body recompositioning.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How much protein should you eat?</strong></p>
<p>The current USDA recommendation for protein intake is at least 0.8 grams of protein per kg of body weight (0.35 g/lb). However, newer research suggests this is likely the <em>absolute minimum</em> amount, and only for relatively young sedentary individuals.</p>
<p>A better minimum intake for most is likely 1.2 g/kg (0.55 g/lb, or about 3 to 5 palm-sized portions of protein-rich foods), especially for older adults, as they’re at greater risk of muscle loss.</p>
<p>Protein intake for muscle growth and retention, and/or if performing resistance training or other vigorous exercise would be 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg (0.75-1 g/lb), or about 4 to 8 palm-sized portions of protein-rich foods.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people eating enough protein?</strong></p>
<p>That depends on how “enough” is defined.</p>
<p>Most adults eat at least 0.8 g/kg. However, up to 10 percent of young women and up to 46 percent of older adults don’t hit this mark.<sup>51</sup> And, as noted, that recommendation is probably conservative compared to the ideal intake.</p>
<p>Protein is also especially critical for those on GLP-1 medications (Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound) to help prevent the muscle loss they can lead to. Aiming for <em>at least</em> 1.2 g/kg is vital for this population, especially if they are also older. (Getting closer to 1.6 g/kg is even better, if possible.)</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is getting more than the recommended amount better?</strong></p>
<p>Once you get up to 1.2 g/kg, not necessarily. That amount is likely adequate for most, especially sedentary folks.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to build muscle and strength or recover from vigorous exercise, or are taking GLP-1 medication for fat loss, striving towards 1.6 g/kg would help you achieve that goal more easily.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to maximize strength and muscle gains, and/or are doing lots of strenuous exercise, consuming 1.6-2.2 g/kg is optimal (with the highest end of that range maxing out all benefits).</p>
<div class="callout_box"></p>
<h2>What about supplements?</h2>
<p>Supplements make up a large part of the discussion around aging, but in reality only play a small role when it comes to increasing health and longevity.</p>
<p>Using supplements (like a multivitamin, or doctor recommended vitamin D or iron) to prevent or correct deficiencies can be helpful for overall health well-being.</p>
<p>Then, there are other supplements that have reasonably strong track records and can help us meet nutritional needs (protein powder), improve performance (creatine), or potentially even slow aging (fish oil might slow biological aging by a small amount).<sup>52</sup></p>
<p>However, the buzziest, trendiest supplements are often less proven.</p>
<p>For example, curcumin, spirulina, and ginger are often listed as supplements that might help with inflammation, a hallmark of aging. However, the research here is still early, and far from definitive.</p>
<p>There are also even less substantiated supplements that might modify other aspects of aging (resveratrol, NAD+, NAC), but the evidence is either very minimal or only in animal models.</p>
<p>Some supplements (especially herbal supplements) can even cause harm, like liver damage.<sup>53</sup></p>
<p>If you want to give supplements a try, check for high-quality third-party seals of approval from organizations such as <a href="https://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/articles/supplement-vitamin-certification">NSF</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Examine.com">Examine.com</a>—an online database that provides independent research summaries and analyses on most popular supplements—is also an excellent resource to help you determine which supplements might actually be effective.</p>
<p>Regardless, talk to your healthcare provider before taking supplements, particularly if you take other medication.</p>
<p></div>
<h3>Foundational Health Behavior #3: Get adequate sleep</h3>
<p>Research shows that men who get enough quality sleep live almost five years longer than men who don&#8217;t, and women who get enough live two and a half years longer.<sup>54</sup></p>
<p>Studies also show sleep is just as important for your heart health as exercise, whole foods, weight management, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar control.<sup>55</sup></p>
<p>Compared to 7 hours of sleep per day, a 1 hour decrease in sleep duration has been associated with an 11 percent increased risk of cardiovascular disease and a 9 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes.<sup>56</sup></p>
<p>Older adults who sleep less than 6 hours per night are at higher risk for dementia and cognitive decline than those who sleep 7 to 8 hours.<sup>57</sup> (Deep sleep helps clear beta-amyloid plaques and wash out toxins from our brain, thought to be partially responsible for dementia.)</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How much sleep should you get?</strong></p>
<p>Sleep experts agree that 7 to 9 hours a night on average—with at least 7 hours of sleep most nights of the week—is ideal for most.</p>
<p>However, the exact ideal hours may vary person to person.</p>
<p>Generally, the right amount of sleep for you is the amount that allows you to feel relatively refreshed shortly after waking up, and allows you to fall asleep relatively easily at bedtime, with relatively sustained energy throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people getting enough sleep? </strong></p>
<p>About a third of US adults don’t meet the recommended amount of 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night.<sup>58</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is getting more than the recommended amount better?</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>It seems that 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night is ideal in terms of health outcomes.<sup>56</sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, longer sleep duration (over 9 hours per night on average) is associated with an <em>increased</em> risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overall mortality.<sup>59 60 61</sup></p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not clear that these risks are <em>caused</em> by sleeping more. Just as likely, it may be other health problems (such as depression, sleep apnea, or heavy alcohol consumption) that lead to both longer sleep times <em>and</em> higher health risks.</p>

<h3>Foundational Health Behavior #4: Manage stress</h3>
<p>When left unchecked for long periods of time (say, months or years without periods of recovery), stress can have negative effects on nearly every aspect of our health, as the below image shows.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147911" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/EffectsOfStress_v2.png" alt="Image shows the variety of effects chronic, unmanaged stress can have on the body, from brain fog, frequent infection, poor recovery, weight gain, and more." width="1024" height="1054" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/EffectsOfStress_v2.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/EffectsOfStress_v2-291x300.png 291w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/EffectsOfStress_v2-995x1024.png 995w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/EffectsOfStress_v2-768x791.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/EffectsOfStress_v2-94x97.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/EffectsOfStress_v2-295x304.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Chronic stress—which tends to increase heart rate, blood pressure, and inflammation—increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.<sup>62 63 64</sup> Additionally, long-term stress tends to worsen mental and emotional health, increasing the risk of anxiety and depression.<sup>65</sup> It can also make people more likely to turn to substances like alcohol as an attempt to cope.<sup>66</sup></p>
<p>That said… Not all stress is bad.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>stress is a normal, natural, and even <em>beneficial</em> part of life; </strong>the right amount helps us feel motivated, purposeful, and engaged with life.</p>
<p>So, rather than avoiding or demonizing stress, it’s helpful to work <em>with </em>it, using it as an opportunity to develop healthy coping mechanisms, appropriate recovery strategies, and overall resilience.</p>
<p>And this doesn’t necessarily mean sitting on a cushion and meditating.</p>
<p>Stress management can include simple mindset shifts: Practicing self-compassion,<sup>67</sup> having a growth mindset,<sup>68</sup> and framing stress as a normal and even beneficial part of life<sup>69</sup> have all been associated with better coping under stress.</p>
<p>Basic self-regulation skills also help. This involves noticing and naming what you’re feeling, having good control over your actions, and using a broad range of coping skills to help yourself process emotions and recover from stress. With these skills, you build self-awareness and the ability to handle challenges better, because you know how to calm yourself down after an activating event—regardless of how it went.</p>
<p>The below image offers a spectrum of more—small and big—ways to regulate stress.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147921" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressWheel.png" alt="Image shows a continuum of options for stress management, ranging from 1 to 10 on an effort scale." width="1024" height="772" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressWheel.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressWheel-300x226.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressWheel-768x579.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressWheel-94x71.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressWheel-295x222.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How much stress management should you engage in?</strong></p>
<p>Think of stress management and recovery as a thing you do <em>in proportion</em> to the stress and demands of your life.</p>
<p>We often use the analogy of a jug: When stress drains your tank, stress management and recovery practices help fill it back up again.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147919" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/recovery-stress.png" alt="Image shows a faucet pouring water into a jug next to a list of recovery practices. These are things that fill your recovery jug. There is also a faucet draining water out of the jug next to a list of stressors. These are things that drain your jug. The goal is to fill your jug as much as you are draining it." width="600" height="490" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/recovery-stress.png 600w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/recovery-stress-300x245.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/recovery-stress-94x77.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/recovery-stress-295x241.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
And, as with all of the foundational health habits we’ve discussed, every little bit counts.</p>
<p>Whether you’re experiencing a little or a lot of stress in your life, even three to five minutes of purposeful recovery—doing deep breathing exercises, some journaling or gentle stretching, or just stepping outside to get some fresh air and listen to the birds—can help fill your tank.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people doing enough to manage stress? </strong></p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>In the US, over a quarter of people report that most days, they’re so stressed they can’t function.<sup>70</sup> In Canada, it’s similar: Just under a quarter of people say that most days in their life are either “quite a bit” or “extremely” stressful.<sup>71</sup></p>
<p>Additionally, over a third of people say they don’t know where to start when it comes to managing their stress.<sup>72</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is getting more than the recommended amount better?</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>The goal is to find your stress “sweet spot.” Because we all enjoy and tolerate different types and amounts of stress, how you feel is actually a pretty good indicator of whether stress is too low, too high, or “just right.”</p>
<p>As the image below shows, if you generally feel bored and purposeless, stress is likely too low; if you feel energized and engaged, stress is probably close to your “sweet spot”; and if you feel panicky or so overwhelmed you’ve started to feel hopeless, stress is likely too high.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147920" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressContinuum.png" alt="Image shows a continuum of stress. When stress is too low, we feel bored or purposeless. When stress is just right, we feel energized and engaged. When stress is too high, we feel anxious or numb." width="1024" height="696" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressContinuum.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressContinuum-300x204.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressContinuum-768x522.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressContinuum-94x64.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/StressContinuum-295x201.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>While having a routine for stress management is a smart idea, there’s likely a point of diminishing returns here too. If you’re in that stress “sweet spot” (energized/engaged, not bored and not overwhelmed), then adding <em>more </em>stress reduction techniques might not help further—and may actually <em>add</em> stress by giving you yet another task to do.</p>
<h3>Foundational Health Behavior #5: Stay socially connected</h3>
<p>You might not think of social connection as a health imperative, but it is.</p>
<p>Not only is the social and emotional support associated with improved well-being, it’s also associated with reduced risk of premature death.<sup>73 74</sup> When relationships are strong, people have a 50 percent increased likelihood of survival during any given time.<sup>75</sup></p>
<p>In fact, one of the longest running studies—the Study of Adult Development out of Harvard Medical School, which has been tracking participants for over 87 years (and counting)—<strong>found that strong relationships were the biggest predictor of not only life satisfaction but longevity.</strong> (Relationships were more predictive of these outcomes than social class, wealth, IQ, or genetics.)<sup>76</sup></p>
<p>No surprise, <em>not having</em> a social circle comes with its own distinct risks.</p>
<p>Social isolation and loneliness can increase a person&#8217;s risk for heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, depression and anxiety, suicidality and self-harm, dementia, and earlier death.<sup>77 78</sup></p>
<p>A frequently cited statistic highlights its profound impact:</p>
<p><strong>The effect of social isolation on mortality is comparable to smoking up to 15 cigarettes per day</strong><sup>79</sup>—surpassing even the risks associated with obesity and physical inactivity.<sup>80</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people getting enough social connection?</strong></p>
<p>It seems many of us could use more friends.</p>
<p>About 1 in 3 adults report feeling lonely, and 1 in 4 report not having social and emotional support.<sup>77</sup></p>
<p>Eight percent of adults say they have no close friends, 53 percent say they have between one and four close friends, and 38 percent report having five or more friends.<sup>81</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How much social connection should you aim for?</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, research finds that people who have three to five close friends they regularly interact with (one to three times per week, in-person or via phone call) get the most social benefit.<sup>82 83 84 85</sup></p>
<p>On average, interaction with a smaller group of people tends to provide more benefit than a large network of acquaintances.<sup>86</sup></p>
<p>That said, individual needs vary. If you feel authentically connected to others, have a strong sense of belonging, and generally feel socially fulfilled, that’s what matters most.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is getting more than the recommended amount better?</strong></p>
<p>Likely not. Some evidence suggests that excessive social engagement (daily or multiple times daily) actually might increase mortality risk.<sup>87</sup> That’s probably because over-socializing can increase mental, emotional, and physical fatigue,<sup>88</sup> and often this level of socialization includes alcohol or other potentially risky behaviors.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can take away time and energy that could be put towards other life-building and health-promoting behaviors (like work, exercise, or sleep).</p>
<p>The takeaway? Strive for socializing that brings value to your life. No need to add so much that you wind up exhausted, or unable to keep up with other priorities.</p>
<h3>Foundational Health Behavior #6: Minimize known harms</h3>
<p>Minimizing activities we know to be harmful is a key part of looking after your long-term health, yet it can be easy to overlook these things. (Maybe because we’d rather keep doing them.)</p>
<p>Two of the biggest culprits are smoking and drinking alcohol.</p>
<h4>Harm Avoidance Key #1: Don’t Smoke</h4>
<p>We all know smoking is bad for us. But smoking is still relatively common:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>In the US, 10.9 percent of adults smoke cigarettes, and 6.6 percent smoke e-cigarettes.<sup>89</sup></li>
<li>Globally, the trend is even higher: 22.3 percent of the world’s population use tobacco (36.7 percent of men and 7.8 percent of women).<sup>90</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The WHO estimates more than 8 million people die prematurely yearly from tobacco use (with an additional 56,000 people dying annually from chewing tobacco).<sup>91</sup> This makes tobacco a leading (i.e. top 3) risk factor for premature death and all-cause mortality.<sup>92</sup></p>
<p>Smoking is also a risk factor for several chronic conditions, including coronary heart disease, stroke, emphysema, and cancer.<sup>93</sup> (Globally, about a quarter of cancer deaths are attributed to smoking.<sup>90</sup>)</p>
<h4>Harm avoidance key #2: Limit alcohol</h4>
<p>At this point, the research is pretty clear: Alcohol has negative implications for your health, especially past a certain point of regular use.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147910" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/DrinkingCancerRisks_v5.png" alt="Two graphs show that risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer increase a lot with heavy drinking, and a little with moderate drinking" width="1024" height="1425" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/DrinkingCancerRisks_v5.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/DrinkingCancerRisks_v5-216x300.png 216w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/DrinkingCancerRisks_v5-736x1024.png 736w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/DrinkingCancerRisks_v5-768x1069.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/DrinkingCancerRisks_v5-86x120.png 86w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/DrinkingCancerRisks_v5-295x411.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Alcohol plays a causal role in 200+ diseases, particularly liver diseases, heart diseases, at least seven types of cancers, depression, anxiety, alcohol use disorders, and dementia.<sup>94 95</sup></p>
<p>In 2019, 2.6 million deaths worldwide were attributable to alcohol consumption.<sup>96</sup> <strong>For people in the 15-49 age range, alcohol is <em>the </em>leading risk factor for death,</strong> with 3.8 percent of female deaths and 12.2 percent of male deaths attributable to alcohol use.<sup>97</sup></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How much alcohol is “safe” to drink?</strong></p>
<p>US guidance on alcohol suggests keeping intake at moderate levels, or less.<sup>98</sup></p>
<p>A moderate intake means:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Two drinks or less per day for men (14 or less per week), with no more than 4 at a single sitting</li>
<li>One drink or less per day for women (7 or less per week), with no more than 3 at a single sitting</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, a drink is defined as containing 14 grams (about 0.6 fluid ounces) of pure ethanol, which equates to:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol by volume)</li>
<li>5 ounces of table wine (12% alcohol by volume)</li>
<li>1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits (40% alcohol by volume)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people limiting their alcohol enough?</strong></p>
<p>In the US, people tend to drink more than the recommended guidelines.</p>
<p>In 2021, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reported that the average American aged 21 or older consumed 2.51 gallons of pure alcohol over the course of a year—equivalent to about 10 standard drinks/week.<sup>99</sup> However, research suggests surveys typically underestimate consumption by 40 to 50 percent.<sup>100</sup> Further, other research shows that the heavier a person drinks, the more significantly they&#8217;re likely to underestimate and/or underreport their drinking.<sup>101</sup></p>
<p>All that to say, the average American is likely having more (or even far more) than 10 drinks per week.</p>
<p>Add to that:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>In 2016, 36.4 percent of Americans (age 15+) said they had at least one episode of binge drinking (6+ drinks in one session) in the last month<sup>102</sup></li>
<li>About 7 percent of the world’s population aged 15+ years have an alcohol use disorder<sup>96</sup></li>
<li>Alcohol-related deaths have been rising: in the last five years, alcohol-induced deaths have increased by 26 percent<sup>103</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is more abstinence from alcohol better?</strong></p>
<p>In 2023, the WHO released a statement saying no amount of alcohol is “safe.”<sup>104</sup> This interpretation is still debated, and data continues to emerge.</p>
<p>Here’s our take: An abstinence-only policy is likely a failed policy for many. Rather, we want people to be informed so they can make intentional decisions.</p>
<p>To be clear, alcohol is not beneficial for physical health; it’s a known human carcinogen. However, while alcohol does increase health risks, risk does not rise in a linear fashion with intake. Meaning, <em>small</em> doses are unlikely to have a significant impact on your health. But when you drink more heavily, the risks rise exponentially.<sup>105</sup></p>
<p>Drinking heavily can mean either:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Having more than 7 drinks in a week for a woman, or more than 14 drinks in a week for a man, or</li>
<li>Having 4 or more drinks in one sitting for a woman, or 5 or more drinks in one sitting for a man (binge drinking).</li>
</ul>
<p>(Reminder: A single drink refers to those definitions mentioned previously. Pints of beer, and heavily poured wine glasses and cocktails are more than single servings… Just because it fits in a single glass doesn’t mean it counts as “one” drink.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>it&#8217;s about finding the level of risk you&#8217;re willing to tolerate relative to whatever benefits you feel alcohol provides you.</strong></p>
<p>Our general recommendations:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>If you’re otherwise healthy and have no other alcohol-related risk factors, limit drinking to moderate levels or less</li>
<li>If you’re otherwise healthy but have one or two alcohol-related risk factors (such as breast cancer history), limit drinking to light levels (1 to 3 or 4 drinks per week) with occasional moderate intakes on special occasions, or less</li>
<li>If you have several alcohol-related risk factors (such as breast cancer history, family history of alcoholism, or contraindicated medications) abstain from alcohol entirely</li>
</ul>
<h3>Foundational Health Behavior #7: Do Basic Preventive Health Measures</h3>
<p>In all the chatter about longevity optimization, it can be easy to forget about all the boring—but no less important—things that help you stay safe and healthy throughout your life.</p>
<p>These include things like:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Getting regular check-ups, or seeing your doctor or healthcare provider if questions or concerns arise</li>
<li>Getting recommended bloodwork, screenings, and vaccines</li>
<li>Getting and keeping blood cholesterol, sugar, and pressure in recommended ranges as early as possible</li>
<li>Regularly seeing your dentist, and regularly brushing and flossing</li>
<li>Practicing safer sex</li>
<li>Seeing medical specialists as recommended or appropriate (OBGYN, optometrist, ENT, dermatologist, etc.)</li>
<li>Wearing seatbelts (Buckling up in the front seat reduces risk of fatal injury by 45 percent!<sup>106</sup>)</li>
<li>Wearing a helmet when cycling, skateboarding, or motorbiking</li>
<li>Regularly wearing sunscreen (Used appropriately, sunscreen decreases risk of skin cancers by 40 to 50 percent<sup>107 108</sup>)</li>
<li>Protecting your hearing (Untreated hearing loss increases risks for depression, social isolation,<sup>109 110</sup> cognitive decline,<sup>111</sup> dementia,<sup>112 113</sup> and falls<sup>114 115</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<p>… And generally using common sense. (As in, avoid the “hold my beer” type stuff.)</p>
<p>Basic health maintenance and risk avoidance practices matter—a lot.</p>
<p>Notably, we can’t control every element of our environment. Some factors influencing our health are more structural and systemic, woven into the fabric of our societies.</p>
<p>These are called <strong>social determinants of health</strong>, and include poverty, racism, homophobia, lack of accommodation for disabilities, and displacement (as in the case of refugees). For some folks, doing the above protective behaviors—like visiting the family doctor, getting glasses, going to the dentist, or even walking safely down the street—will be harder, sometimes near impossible.</p>
<p>This isn’t meant to be a throwaway line that diminishes the difficult reality for so many people, but rather a gritty, realistic mantra: Do the best you can with what you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How much preventative health care do you need to do? </strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, aim to be consistent with the habits you know you “should” do.</p>
<p>You know the drill: Brush and floss daily; wear your helmet every time you ride a bike; wear your seatbelt every time you drive; put on sunscreen when you go out into the midday sun; don’t regularly blast your music at full volume; and so on.</p>
<p>And if you have lingering things on your “I should really do that” list (like getting that weird mole checked out, or that bloodwork done), go do it.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are people practicing enough basic preventative health measures?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve offered a long-ish list of basic health practices that can protect health, so we won’t go into each in-depth.</p>
<p>That said, when looking at the above list, it&#8217;s probably fair to say most people will notice a few behaviors they might practice more consistently.</p>
<p>For example, while most of us are <em>really </em>consistent with our seat belts (usage is close to 92 percent!<sup>116</sup>), many of us could break out the floss more often (only 32 percent of Americans floss daily<sup>117</sup>).</p>
<p>And, research shows that only about half of cyclists and motorcyclists wear helmets when riding<sup>118 119 120</sup> (and use is even lower among skateboarders and rollerbladers<sup>121</sup>).</p>
<p>Hearing loss is the number one modifiable risk factor for dementia,<sup>122</sup> so make sure you also follow the “60/60 rule” if you like to pump up the tunes on your headphones: Listen at 60 percent of your device&#8217;s maximum volume for 60 minutes, then take a break. (And wear earplugs when you mow the lawn!)</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are more preventative measures better?</strong></p>
<p>Once again, there&#8217;s likely a law of diminishing returns when it comes to preventative health measures, just like everything else.</p>
<p>The point isn’t to become obsessed with eliminating all possible risks at every turn.</p>
<p>Rather, it’s that <strong>reasonable efforts towards protecting your health <em>do</em> count, and they‘re immeasurably more important for overall health than the latest optimization fads.</strong></p>
<div class="callout_box"></p>
<h2>Bonus Foundational Health Behavior: Foster a sense of purpose and meaning</h2>
<p>Research consistently shows that having a strong sense of purpose and meaning for our life improves our health, overall well-being, and longevity too.<sup>123</sup></p>
<p>A sense of purpose seems to help people live longer, even when controlling for other markers of psychological well-being.</p>
<p><strong>There’s something uniquely beneficial about having a strong purpose that’s different from, say, being <em>happy</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Having a strong sense of purpose can mean many things, but it generally indicates that you have goals, and an aim in life.</p>
<p>This purpose can be many things:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Helping others</li>
<li>Being connected to family and/or close friends</li>
<li>Being a key part of a community</li>
<li>Enjoying a hobby</li>
<li>Learning new skills</li>
</ul>
<p>Having purpose may help with longevity for a few reasons:</p>
<p>It makes you more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors, such as getting enough sleep and eating more fruits and vegetables.<sup>123</sup></p>
<p>It also tends to improve mental health. For example, one study showed that people with the strongest sense of purpose had a 43 percent reduced risk of depression.<sup>123</sup></p>
<p>Finally, it may simply help people live longer because<em> it makes you want to live longer</em>. When people have a sense of purpose, they often want to live longer, healthier lives, so they can fulfill that purpose to its fullest. And while wanting to live won’t make it so, it certainly doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p></div>
<h2>Still thinking about optimizing? Consider these additional tradeoffs</h2>
<p>We hope it’s clear by now: You can take yourself really far with some solid basics (that will themselves take some decent time and effort!).</p>
<p>But, if you want to go even further, your effort might have to increase exponentially, just as those gains become less certain, and more marginal.</p>
<p>Here’s what to keep in mind.</p>
<h3>First, it takes a lot of time (and money) to optimize.</h3>
<p>Let’s compare the time and financial investment of two imaginary people.</p>
<p>The first person is what you might call a “healthy” or “medium effort” person. They’re someone who is pretty consistently meeting all of the above recommendations.</p>
<p>The second person is what you might call an “optimizer.” They do all the above recommendations, but to the max, <em>and </em>many of the fringe recommendations often discussed on health-related podcasts and books.</p>
<p>How much time and money might each of these people invest in their health efforts on a weekly basis? Here’s what that might look like.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147922" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/WeeklyTally_v6.png" alt="Table compares various activities and costs of a regular healthy person and an “optimizer”. Generally, it takes 3 to 4 times the time and cost to “optimize” exercise, nutrition, and self-care activities." width="1024" height="1000" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/WeeklyTally_v6.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/WeeklyTally_v6-300x293.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/WeeklyTally_v6-768x750.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/WeeklyTally_v6-94x92.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/WeeklyTally_v6-295x288.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>On top of that, there are “optimizing” behaviors and assessments that might be performed less often—say, monthly, seasonally, annually, or even every few years. Of course, these practices will still require time and money, so even though they’re less frequent, they still have to be accounted for.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of those kinds of products, therapies, and tests:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Dietary supplements (vitamin, mineral, and/or herbal supplements; “superfoods”; fish oil; probiotics, resveratrol, NAD+, NAC, curcumin, &amp; more)</li>
<li>Bloodwork testing (for advanced lipid testing, inflammatory markers, hormone levels, and nutrient status)</li>
<li>IV therapy (for hydration, vitamins, glutathione, or NAD+)</li>
<li>Infrared sauna sessions</li>
<li>Plasma transfusions</li>
<li>Gene therapy</li>
<li>Stem cell therapy</li>
<li>Medical tourism and therapeutics retreats</li>
<li>Full-body MRIs</li>
<li>Genetic testing</li>
<li>Concierge medical services</li>
<li>And more…</li>
</ul>
<p>Though it’s hard to estimate the cost of these items, opting to do just a handful could easily cost an extra $10,000+ per year.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>we’d estimate it takes <em>at least</em> three to four times the time, effort, and money to follow an “optimizer” type lifestyle, compared to a plain old “healthy” lifestyle.</strong></p>
<p>As we’ve seen above, this 3-4x effort will <em>likely</em> translate to some extra benefits, but the medium-effort “healthy” lifestyle will likely get most people <em>at least</em> 80 percent of the results they’re after (such as improved lifespan, healthspan, and quality of life).</p>
<h3 id="enjoying-life">Besides, optimizing <em>too</em> much can negatively impact your well-being and quality of life.</h3>
<p>The harder and more extreme someone’s fitness or health regime, the harder they typically fall off the wagon. So, taking on too much can actually put you more at risk of quitting the foundational health behaviors we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Even if you stick with it, <strong>over-focusing on health and longevity will almost certainly interfere with your ability to enjoy a full, well-rounded, meaningful life. </strong></p>
<p>For example, if you get <em>too</em> focused on physical health, you may find other aspects of your <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/healthspan-and-longevity">deep health</a> and overall wellbeing suffer, such as your relational, existential, mental, and emotional health.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147909" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/deep-health-wheel-with-text.png" alt="Image shows that there are six domains of deep health: social, physical, existential, emotional, mental, and environmental." width="900" height="701" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/deep-health-wheel-with-text.png 900w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/deep-health-wheel-with-text-300x234.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/deep-health-wheel-with-text-768x598.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/deep-health-wheel-with-text-94x73.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/05/deep-health-wheel-with-text-295x230.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Take this a step further, and “optimizing” can tip over into obsession. Sometimes, under the surface of “I just really care about my health” is disordered eating, orthorexia, or another mental health condition.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147916" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/07/lifelongevitygraph_r2.png" alt="Graph shows that with small amounts of health effort, life satisfaction and overall well-being can improve a lot, but as those efforts increase, well-being benefits plateau" width="1024" height="669" /></p>
<p><strong>This, to us, is the heart of things: It’s important to not only stay relatively healthy, but also to <em>enjoy your life </em>while you’re living it. </strong></p>
<p>In fact, enjoying your life isn’t separate from good health. <em>It’s part of it.</em></p>
<h2>What to do next</h2>
<h3>1. Clarify your goals.</h3>
<p>Take a step back and consider what you really want most for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of life do you want to have?</strong></p>
<p>How important is it to maximize your healthspan and lifespan, and how does that line up with your other priorities?</p>
<h3>2. Consider the tradeoffs.</h3>
<p>Given what you want most for yourself, and the resources you have available, <strong>what’s realistic for you? </strong></p>
<p>How much time, money, and effort are you willing to put in to achieve health and lifespan goals?</p>
<p>What are you prepared to give up? What <em>aren’t </em>you prepared to give up?</p>
<h3>3. When looking to make improvements, start with the basics first.</h3>
<p>Review the foundational health behaviors in this article. How many of them are you already doing? <em>Consistently?</em></p>
<p>If you’re covering most of the basics, you might not need to do more. (Give yourself a pat on the back. You’re already elite!)</p>
<p>Or, maybe there’s some room for improvement and you’d like to step it up a bit. Great! For the vast majority of people, improving any of these behaviors will deliver real, tangible results. Start with these, before chasing faddish, fringe, “super-optimal” stuff.</p>
<h3>4. Tune out the noise.</h3>
<p>Those people you hear on podcasts or social media aren’t the experts on you and your life.</p>
<p><em>You</em> get to decide what you want, and how to go about getting it.</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself, and make choices aligned with what matters most to you.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of advice out there, but remember: It’s your life. You get to make decisions that work for <em>you</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Are vegetable and seed oils “toxic”?!</h2>
<p>From TikTok to bestseller lists, vegetable oils—a.k.a. “seed oils”—are a big topic right now.</p>
<p>To be fair, folks have debated the merits of vegetable oils dating back to when they first entered the marketplace.</p>
<p>More recently, however, with the advent of the <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/carnivore-diet">carnivore diet</a>, vegetable oil hate has roared back into the socials. Maybe you’ve come across posts that refer to these cooking oils as “toxic sludge,” “motor oil,” “the hateful eight,” and “the biggest cause of chronic disease that nobody knows about.”</p>
<p>The anti-vegetable oil logic goes something like this…</p>
<p>Animal fats have been with humans for thousands of years. Vegetable fats, on the other hand, were invented during the last century when profit-seeking companies wanted to find a way to sell cheap-to-grow foods to unsuspecting consumers.</p>
<p>Another argument: Like margarine, vegetable oils were marketed as healthier alternatives for butter, and yet, people argue, these oils are <em>worse</em> than butter, raising your risk for obesity, anxiety, depression, ulcerative colitis, and more.</p>
<p>In contrast to the above line of thought, other experts will tell you that vegetable oils are harmless, potentially even health-promoting—and absolutely better than butter.</p>
<p>So, who’s right?</p>
<p><strong>Like so many nutrition topics, the truth is too nuanced to fit on a meme. </strong></p>
<p>In this story, we’ll help you sort the science from the pseudoscience so you can make informed decisions about the oils you choose to include in your diet.</p>
<h2>What are vegetable oils?</h2>
<p>Sometimes called “seed oils,” vegetable oils start, as you might suspect, from the seed of a plant. The most common ones you’ll find in a typical grocery aisle include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canola oil</li>
<li>Corn oil</li>
<li>Safflower oil</li>
<li>Sesame oil</li>
<li>Sunflower oil</li>
<li>Soybean oil</li>
<li>Grapeseed oil</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, if you feel like there’s a bunch of oils missing from that list, it’s probably because those oils come from non-seed plants (such as olive, avocado, palm, or coconut oil, which all come from fruits, and aren’t considered vegetable or seed oils).</p>
<h2>How are vegetable oils processed?</h2>
<p>Non-vegetable oils—such as olive and avocado oil—are derived from naturally fatty foods. In fact, olives are so oily that you could theoretically make your own olive oil at home. (Just Google “how to make olive oil from scratch,” and you’ll find a number of videos walking you through the steps.)</p>
<p>The same can’t be said of most vegetable oils, which mostly come from foods with a relatively tiny fat content to begin with.</p>
<p>Case in point: A cup of green olives contains about 20 grams of fat,<sup>1</sup> whereas a cup of corn has 2 grams.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>As a result, manufacturers must use an extensive multi-step process to extract this small amount of oil from these non-oily foods. These steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crushing</strong>: A machine uses high pressure to press oil from the seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Refining</strong>: The seeds are heated with a solvent, such as hexane, to extract more oil.</li>
<li><strong>Deodorizing</strong>: To create a neutral taste and remove unwanted compounds, the extracted oil is then cooked at 400 F (204 C) for several hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this process, health-promoting polyphenols and other stabilizing nutrients are lost, and <strong>small amounts of unsaturated fats are transformed into trans fatty acids</strong> (also called partially hydrogenated fat).</p>
<p>(Interesting fact: This also happens during deep frying. When vegetable oils sizzle in a restaurant’s deep fryer for hours, the trans fat content of the oil increases.)</p>
<p>To call these processed oils “toxic” might be an exaggeration. However, nutrition scientists generally agree that people should avoid trans fats in the diet, and in 2018, the Food and Drug Administration banned manufacturers from adding trans fats to processed foods.<sup>3 4</sup></p>
<h2>What cooking oils should you eat?</h2>
<p>At PN, we’ve created several <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/what-should-i-eat-infographic">visual guides</a> people can use to make informed decisions about what to eat.</p>
<p>(We’ve also created a shopping list, which you or your clients can print out and take to the grocery store. Check it out: <a href="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2019/09/Healthy-fats-shopping-list.pdf">Healthy Fats Shopping List</a>)</p>
<p>In these guides, we’ve placed a few vegetable oils—expeller-pressed canola oil, high-oleic sunflower, and safflower oils—in the “Eat Some” section. <strong>For us, “eat some” is another way of saying that these foods will neither improve health nor harm health—when consumed in reasonable amounts. </strong>In some cases, like in the example of dark chocolate, when consumed in small amounts, they might even improve health.</p>
<p>The rest of the vegetable oils, along with butter and other saturated fats, fall into the “Eat Less” category, as the image below shows. <strong>You’ll find vegetable oils in bold.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146852" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/Fat-Sources-Blog-1.png" alt="An infographic showing dietary recommendations for different cooking oils and fats, divided into three categories: 'EAT MORE' (including extra virgin olive oil, walnut oil, and avocado oil), 'EAT SOME' (including various oils like flaxseed and coconut), and 'EAT LESS' (including butter, margarine, and various processed oils)." width="1024" height="670" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/Fat-Sources-Blog-1.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/Fat-Sources-Blog-1-300x196.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/Fat-Sources-Blog-1-768x503.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/Fat-Sources-Blog-1-94x62.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/Fat-Sources-Blog-1-295x193.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>We’ve gotten hate mail from folks who say certain vegetable oils—especially cold-pressed canola oil—should appear alongside olive oil in the “eat more” category. Plenty of others say <em>all </em>vegetable oils belong in the “eat less” column, and that butter belongs in “eat some” or even “eat more.”</p>
<p>To understand the scientific reasoning behind our recommendations, let’s explore some head-to-head matchups.</p>
<h2>Extra-virgin olive oil vs. expeller-pressed canola oil</h2>
<p>These oils are the least refined of their kind.</p>
<p>To make extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), manufacturers grind and mechanically press olives, without using any heat. Similarly, expeller-pressed canola oil is made by mechanically pressing rapeseed, without the use of heat or chemical solvents.</p>
<h3><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f7e2.png" alt="🟢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong>The case for extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)</h3>
<p>Olive oil is richer in heart-healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) than almost any other cooking oil.</p>
<p>In addition, unlike the more refined “light” olive oil, EVOO maintains most of the olive fruit’s original polyphenols. These plant-based substances help to combat inflammation and protect cells from damage.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly…</p>
<p><strong>More studies vouch for EVOO’s health-promoting qualities than for any other cooking fat.</strong></p>
<p>For example, researchers asked 22,892 adults from Southern Italy to self-report their olive oil consumption. People who consumed the most olive oil (more than two tablespoons a day) were 20 percent less likely to die over the 13-year study than people who consumed the least olive oil (less than one tablespoon a day).<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Other research has linked the consumption of olive oil with a reduced risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>High blood pressure<sup>6</sup></li>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Type 2 diabetes<sup>7</sup></li>
<li>Dementia<sup>8</sup></li>
<li>Cancer<sup>9</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Consumption of olive oil is also associated with reductions in LDL cholesterol, especially when used to replace saturated fats like butter and coconut oil.<sup>10</sup><br />
<div class="callout_box"></p>
<h2>Smoke point: Should you avoid cooking with olive oil?</h2>
<p>Years ago, culinary experts recommended using EVOO only on salads and other uncooked foods. Back then, they assumed EVOO&#8217;s relatively low smoke point (350 to 410F) meant the oil would break down when heated, losing some of its distinctive flavor <em>and </em>health benefits.</p>
<p>We now know that smoke point isn’t as big a deal as previously thought.</p>
<p>That’s especially true in the case of EVOO, whose polyphenols and high concentrations of monounsaturated fats help keep the oil stable when heated.</p>
<p>In research that heated a variety of cooking oils to 464 F (240C) and then held them at 356 F (180C) for several hours, <strong>EVOO remained more stable than any other oil tested, including canola oil.</strong><sup>11</sup></p>
<p></div></p>
<h3><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f7e1.png" alt="🟡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong>The case for expeller-pressed canola oil</h3>
<p>One of the more affordable cooking oils on the shelf, canola oil, is made from a Canadian-made hybrid of the rapeseed plant.</p>
<p>(The word “canola” refers to the first three letters of “Canada” with a fun “ola” added to the end for marketing purposes.)<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Among vegetable oils, canola is the richest in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (though several non-vegetable oils have it beat) as well as alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid.</p>
<p>In addition, canola oil contains plant substances called phytosterols that help influence blood cholesterol for the better, especially when used as a substitute for butter, research has found.<sup>13 14 15</sup></p>
<h3>The winner</h3>
<p><strong>Extra virgin olive oil is the clear winner.</strong></p>
<p>The body of research in support of EVOO dwarfs the body of research in support of expeller-pressed canola.</p>
<p>In addition, EVOO has a more favorable fatty acid profile. By the way, so does avocado oil, which is why you’ll also find it in the “eat more” column.</p>
<p>However, you can buy roughly twice as much expeller-pressed canola oil for half as much money as EVOO. Because of this, expeller-pressed canola can be a good budget-friendly choice. In addition, because of expeller-pressed canola&#8217;s more neutral flavor, many people prefer it over EVOO for baking.</p>
<p>When used in moderation, expeller-pressed canola can be part of a healthy diet. It is likely to be <em>at least</em> health neutral, if not somewhat health beneficial.</p>
<h2>Expeller-pressed canola oil vs. refined canola oil</h2>
<p>This match-up comes down to how processing methods affect the end product.</p>
<h3><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f7e1.png" alt="🟡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong>Expeller-pressed canola oil</h3>
<p>An expeller press is a machine that squeezes oil out of seeds.</p>
<p>It’s able to do this without the use of solvents or heat, which helps preserve beneficial compounds such as alpha-linolenic acid and phytosterols.</p>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f534.png" alt="🔴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Refined canola oil</h3>
<p>Refining removes some protective alpha-linoleic acid while adding small amounts of unhealthy trans fatty acids. This results in a product that is proportionally lower in omega-3 fatty acids and higher in omega-6 fatty acids.</p>
<h3>The winner</h3>
<p><strong>Expeller-pressed canola oil wins, but only by a small margin.</strong></p>
<p>That’s because canola oil starts with a less controversial fatty acid profile than many other vegetable oils, as the chart below shows. Soybean oil, for example, has less heart-healthy monounsaturated fat and much more <em>theoretically</em> inflammation-contributing omega-6 fat.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146853" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2.png" alt="A chart titled 'Fatty Acid Ratios of Various Cooking Fats' comparing the percentages of different fatty acids (monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega-3, omega-6, and saturated) across six types of fats: extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, walnut oil, canola oil, soybean oil, and butter." width="4267" height="2250" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2.png 4267w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2-300x158.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2-1024x540.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2-768x405.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2-1536x810.png 1536w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2-2048x1080.png 2048w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2-94x50.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/CookingFatsTable_v2-295x156.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 4267px) 100vw, 4267px" /></p>
<div class="callout_box"></p>
<h2>Are omega 6 fatty acids “inflammatory?”</h2>
<p>The typical American consumes around 16 to 20 times more omega-6 fats than omega-3s.</p>
<p>This imbalance could <em>theoretically</em> increase inflammation in your body, potentially raising your risk for diabetes, obesity, and other health problems, argue some experts.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Years ago, the recommendation to balance your omega 6s with omega 3s was widespread. (The suggested “ideal” ratio: Anywhere from 1:1 to 4:1, in favor of omega 6s.)</p>
<p>These days, there’s more debate among nutritional scientists as to whether this imbalance contributes to chronic inflammation, especially when those omega 6s are consumed in whole foods that contain many other beneficial compounds.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>nuts and seeds—both naturally rich in omega-6 fats—have been associated with a range of health benefits</strong>, including reductions in blood cholesterol and inflammation.<sup>17 18</sup></p>
<p>In 2019, Harvard Health ran the headline “<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/no-need-to-avoid-healthy-omega-6-fats">No need to avoid healthy omega-6 fats</a>.” In support of their argument, a 2019 study from the American Heart Association journal <em>Circulation</em> determined that, if anything, the consumption of omega-6 fats <em>reduced</em> the risk for stroke, heart disease, and early death.<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>However, while nuts and refined canola oil may share a somewhat similar fatty acid profile, the two foods differ in one important way. As we mentioned earlier, refined canola oil is basically pure oil. Meanwhile, <strong>nuts and seeds come packaged with health-protective fiber, polyphenols, protein, vitamins, and minerals.</strong></p>
<p>Minimally-processed foods, like nuts or extra virgin oils, include a complex matrix of health-promoting nutrients. Highly-processed oils, on the other hand, have lost the vast majority of those healthful compounds, leaving mostly just the fatty acids which are more prone to oxidation (we’ll cover that next).</p>
<p></div>
<h2>Refined vegetable oil oil vs. butter</h2>
<p><strong>This is the match-up that triggers the most arguing on the interwebs.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s cover the major claims from both sides—plus what the research says.</p>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f534.png" alt="🔴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The case for butter</h3>
<p>Butter proponents argue that saturated fats have been unnecessarily vilified. They point to nutrition recommendations during the 1980s and 1990s that recommended people replace butter with trans-fat rich margarine.</p>
<p>(We all know how that went.)</p>
<p>Margarine aside, others claim the research in support of reducing saturated fats is thin at best.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>However, <strong>excessive saturated fat consumption (beyond 10 percent of total calories) does seem to boost cholesterol levels and may increase your risk of heart disease.</strong><sup>21</sup></p>
<p>Some research has found that replacing 5 percent of the saturated fats in your diet with monounsaturated fats could reduce the risk of heart disease by 15 percent. Similarly, replacing 5 percent of the saturated fats in your diet with polyunsaturated fats (with most of that coming from refined vegetable oils) reduces the risk of a future heart attack by 10 percent, according to an analysis of eight studies involving 13,614 people.<sup>22</sup> Many other studies support this finding.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>But not all saturated fats affect blood cholesterol equally. In some dairy foods, a membrane—called a <strong>milk fat globule membrane</strong>—surrounds the saturated fats and seems to limit their cholesterol-raising properties.</p>
<p>However, butter is low in this protective membrane, and consequently raises blood cholesterol more than other high-fat dairy products, like full-fat milk, cream, yogurt, or cheese.<sup>24 25 26</sup></p>
<p><strong>The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend capping saturated fat at less than 10 percent of your calorie intake.</strong> A tablespoon of butter contains 7 grams of saturated fat—a third of the recommended daily limit in a 2000 Calorie diet.</p>
<p>So, while you don’t necessarily need to eliminate butter, it’s worth moderating your intake.</p>

<p>Due to their chemical structure, <strong>polyunsaturated fats are inherently less stable and more prone to oxidation than saturated or monounsaturated fats.</strong></p>
<p>During the refining process, protective phytochemicals and antioxidants are stripped, making these oils more prone to oxidation. The theory is that this oxidation increases inflammation in the body and elevates the risk of various health conditions.</p>
<p>There’s some evidence to suggest that diets rich in polyunsaturated fats, especially from refined vegetable oils, are associated with increased levels of oxidized blood lipids, lipid peroxidation, and other markers of inflammation.<sup>27 28</sup></p>
<p>If you only use refined corn or safflower oils to lightly coat veggies before roasting them, you likely don’t have much to worry about.</p>
<p>However, <strong>for the vast majority of people, the biggest source of refined vegetable oils isn’t home-cooked meals—it’s ultra-processed foods. </strong></p>
<p>The extra processing and repeated heat exposure used to create ultra-processed foods further oxidize these oils. Additionally, these foods are often loaded with potentially harmful ingredients like added sodium and sugars, and low in beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients.</p>
<p>Plus, they’re incredibly calorie-dense and difficult to stop eating, which can raise your risk for obesity. (Find out exactly why highly-processed foods are so &#8220;addictive&#8221;: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/why-you-cant-stop-overeating">Why you can’t stop eating ultra-processed foods</a>.)</p>
<p>Most ultra-processed foods list one or more vegetable oils as one of their ingredients. Even ultra-processed foods that you wouldn’t think of as “fatty” contain small amounts. You’ll find them in store-bought cookies, chips, crackers, sauces, frozen dinners, meal replacement shakes, boxed macaroni and cheese, salad dressing, boxed rice blends, and more.</p>
<p>In a large review involving nearly 10 million people, the consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher risk of premature death.<sup>29</sup> In addition, studies have linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods with the following health problems:<sup>30 31 32 33</sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Heart disease and heart attacks</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Overweight and obesity</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Reduced HDL cholesterol</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to abolish ultra-processed foods.</p>
<p>But your health will benefit from capping your consumption to about 20 percent or so of your intake, with the other 80 percent or so from mostly minimally-processed whole foods.</p>
<p>This alone will naturally lower your refined vegetable oil intake to a safer level, without much fuss. Plus, consuming refined vegetable oils in the context of a diet that’s rich in colorful plants, fiber, phytochemicals, and antioxidants may help offset the concern of oxidation. (For example, by putting a reasonable amount of commercial salad dressing on a large, colorful salad.)</p>
<h3>The winner</h3>
<p><strong>This match-up is a draw.</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, both should be limited in the diet, and neither are health-<em>promoting.</em></p>
<p>Most refined vegetable oils are lopsidedly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to monounsaturated fats, and are stripped of many protective compounds. As mentioned earlier, some experts argue that these omega-6-rich fats may contribute to inflammation (but the evidence here is mixed). Because of how they’re processed, seed oils also contain some of those trans fats that everyone agrees we should all minimize.</p>
<p>In contrast, butter is low in omega 6s but high in saturated fat, which can be problematic in higher amounts. Especially since it&#8217;s so low in the protective milk fat globule membrane. However, compared to refined vegetable oil, butter is less processed. Like olive oil, it’s one of those fats you could theoretically make at home.</p>
<h2>Some final parting advice</h2>
<p>This might be obvious from the head-to-head matchups, but we’ll say it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>If you like it and can afford it, EVOO is a great choice. </strong></p>
<p>Cold-pressed avocado oil and walnut oil are also great options, as both are rich in antioxidant compounds. Like EVOO, avocado oil is a rich source of MUFAs. Walnut oil’s fat primarily comes from polyunsaturated fats, so it’s best used as a dressing rather than used for cooking (as it’s less heat stable).</p>
<p>However, like EVOO, avocado and walnut oil tend to be expensive. <strong>If you or your client are budget-conscious, expeller-pressed canola oil is a solid runner-up. </strong></p>
<p>Similarly, high-oleic sunflower and safflower oils are richer sources of monounsaturated fats than their high-linoleic cousins. When substituted for saturated fats like butter, high-oleic oils have been associated with cardiovascular benefits.<sup>34 35</sup></p>
<p>Regardless of what cooking fats you or your client choose, you’ll also want to do the following:</p>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Prioritize minimally-processed whole foods.</h3>
<p>Whole and minimally-processed foods—such as nuts, seeds, avocados, olives, and salmon—are more likely to feature health-promoting monounsaturated (MUFAs) and omega-3 fats. They also come packaged with a wide array of other good-for-you nutrients such as fiber, protein, minerals, and antioxidants.</p>
<p>In contrast, ultra-professed foods are generally devoid of everything you keep hearing you should consume more of. These foods also tend to be calorie-dense, highly rewarding, and hard to stop eating.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure whether packaged food is minimally processed or highly processed, take a close look and consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does anything in nature resemble this food?</li>
<li>Does it look like it came from an animal or a plant?</li>
<li>If you look at the list of ingredients, do you see animal or plant components?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answer “no” to most of the above, the food is likely highly processed.</p>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Limit deep-fried foods.</h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter what source of fat is used to fry them.</p>
<p>Sort all fried foods into the “eat less” category.</p>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get most of your fats from food, not oils.</h3>
<p>EVOO is associated with longer, healthier lives. However, that doesn’t mean you should be doing shots of it.</p>
<p>As a general rule, you’re better off getting most of your fat from foods like avocados, olives, nuts and seeds than from any cooking oil.</p>
<p>Whole food fats are rich in fiber, phytochemicals, vitamins, and minerals, and are generally less calorie-dense than oils. (But having one to three servings of oils or butter per day is reasonable.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>While our ancestors relied on their senses to assess how they were doing, increasingly, we rely on gadgets.</h2>
<p>Today, if you’re curious enough, you can measure your heart rate, your step count, your exercise intensity, and your sleep quality—sometimes all on one sleek device.</p>
<p>In the best cases, <strong>these devices offer a bridge between what you subjectively feel and what you can objectively measure.</strong></p>
<p>This is generally a really cool and amazing thing.</p>
<p>Our subjective feelings and assessments matter, but they’re not always the most reliable. Us humans just aren’t particularly skilled at quantifying our experiences and behaviors with cold precision.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a colleague of mine. He believed he was eating within a narrow caloric window, but after careful tracking, he learned that he was putting away a bonus 500 Calories a day—in barbecue sauce.</p>
<p>That said, some of us are better than others.</p>
<p>Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter, was reported to have been able to call out his 100 metre time within a tenth of a second of the stopwatch readout.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>That’s outlier performance, to be clear, but it still makes you wonder:</p>
<h3>How good are you at assessing yourself?</h3>
<p>And, how can you<strong> improve your accuracy through the wise use of technology—like fitness trackers—to help you make better decisions about your health?</strong></p>
<p>In the following article, we’ll tackle the above, plus we’ll address:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li><strong>How accurate are data trackers </strong>in the first place?</li>
<li><strong>When is tracking helpful? </strong>(And when is it not?)</li>
<li>Can you train yourself to <strong>more accurately assess things by feel?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get into it.</p>
<h2>First, how accurate are data trackers anyway?</h2>
<p><strong>Not all data is created equal. </strong></p>
<p>Some brands produce better products than others. This is not just hardware but also the quality of their software and datasets.</p>
<p>Beyond that, not all things are equally easy to quantity.</p>
<p>For example, heart rate and step-count data are generally reliable,<sup>2</sup> but many other types of outputs—from calories burned to movement velocity—have substantial margins for error.</p>

<h2>Next, when is tracking actually helpful?</h2>
<p>The good: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before.</p>
<p>The bad: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before.</p>
<p>“What’s really remarkable,” says Samantha Kleinberg, a computer scientist who studies decision-making, “is that even a tiny amount of surplus information has a big negative effect on our decision-making.”<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>That’s the paradox of tracking: <strong>Too little detail makes it tough to make the right decision, but so does too much. </strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146831" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1.png" alt="A graph showing 'The Effect of Information on Decision Making' with an inverted U-shaped curve. The x-axis shows 'Amount of relevant information available' and the y-axis shows 'Ability to make decisions'. The peak of the curve is labeled 'Sweet spot', suggesting an optimal amount of information for decision-making, with performance declining when there's either too little or too much information." width="4267" height="3063" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1.png 4267w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1-300x215.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1-1024x735.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1-768x551.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1-1536x1103.png 1536w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1-2048x1470.png 2048w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1-94x67.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2025/01/DecisionMakingGraphic_f1-295x212.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 4267px) 100vw, 4267px" /></p>
<p>This can be expressed as an inverted U, with the sweet spot at the top of the curve.</p>
<h3>Today, it’s surprisingly easy to have too much information.</h3>
<p>Consider the analysis paralysis you feel after scanning hundreds of reviews from the various taco places in your neighborhood. (All you wanted was a decent <em>el pastor,</em> but now you don’t know which <em>taqueria</em> to pick!)</p>
<p>Finding just enough information to make good decisions is an art form—especially in the world of health and fitness, where it seems like everyone is trying to outdo each other when it comes to providing more science, more customization, and more complexity.</p>
<p>But when all that information starts to blur together with no clear path forward, what should you do?</p>
<p>For starters, you can ask yourself a simple question:</p>
<p><strong>Does tracking increase my wellbeing and performance?</strong></p>
<p>If the answer is a clear yes or no, you know what to do. (Either continue tracking as you were, or drop the gadget and walk away.)</p>
<p>If you’re a little fuzzy, here are three signs to watch for to help you determine if tracking is helpful—or not.</p>
<h2>Sign #1: Tracking is decreasing your stress and validating your method(s).</h2>
<p>When Zak’s coach raved about the benefits of zone 2 cardio, it sounded logical. But when the rubber on his running shoes hit the road, Zak second-guessed everything. Zak prided himself on his ability to grind, and simply didn’t trust that something that <em>felt </em>easy could also be effective.</p>
<p>Yet, the data didn’t lie. As the weeks went by, Zak watched his resting heart rate drop—along with his recovery time from hard runs. With that reassurance, Zak began to relax about the process—and his resting heart rate dropped further.</p>
<p>Zak hadn’t trusted his feelings, but he <em>did</em> trust the data from his heart rate monitor.</p>
<p>Using a tracking device enabled Zak to calibrate his own perceptions so they were more accurate and realistic.</p>
<p>If you’re a coach who has a client like Zak who’s high performing but doesn’t know it, <strong>tracking can help build confidence and reduce the anxiety that they’re “not good enough.”</strong></p>
<p>Here, you empower them by shining a spotlight on existing performance. Expert assurance can go a long way but can also be bolstered by reliable data.</p>
<p>(Recently, many people have begun using continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, in order to “optimize” their blood sugar levels. This <em>can </em>help “validate” certain food choices… but it can also be a waste of time. Read more: <strong><a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/continuous-glucose-monitors">Should people without diabetes use CGMs?</a></strong>)</p>
<h3>Bad omen: Tracking is increasing stress or negatively affecting performance.</h3>
<p><strong>Sometimes, data can stress you out without any upside—like when you receive poor scores about things beyond your control.</strong></p>
<p>Take the new parent of a newborn who gets a poor sleep quality score.</p>
<p>Tracking has a time and a place. When scores are <strong>beyond your control</strong> or your priorities lie elsewhere, tracking can create unnecessary stress and is counterproductive.</p>
<p>You can always revisit tracking when circumstances or priorities change.</p>
<h2>Sign #2: Clear feedback from data is enhancing your motivation and ability.</h2>
<p>For a behaviour to take place, you need three things<sup>4</sup>:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li><strong>Motivation: </strong>A compelling reason or desire to take action toward achieving something. This can come from external sources (your spouse is urging you to quit smoking) or internal drives (you’ve always dreamed of running a marathon).</li>
<li><strong>Ability: </strong>You have a combination of skills, plus opportunities to express them. (For example, you know how to do a simple resistance training routine, and you have 20 minutes a day to execute it.) This may involve overcoming constraints like time, money, mental and/or physical effort, social pressures, and changes to routine.<sup>5</sup></li>
<li><strong>Prompt: </strong>A prompt is a cue or instruction that elicits an action. (For example, when your GPS tells you to turn left, or when your restless legs &#8220;remind&#8221; you you’re due for a walk.) Critically, even with high levels of motivation and ability, you may not take action—or the right <em>kind</em> of action—without a prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fitness trackers shine when you’ve got plenty of motivation and ability—and just lack the prompt.</strong></p>
<p>Take my client, Margaret. She used to have a glass of wine most nights, believing it helped her sleep better. Once she started wearing a sleep tracker though, she saw that her sleep quality was much poorer the nights she imbibed. Once she received this prompt—her sleep score—she adjusted her behavior.</p>
<p><strong>When you highlight important data, the right choices become clearer. </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to changing behaviours, sometimes all it takes is one key piece of data. As they say, “Once you see it, you can’t un-see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>(PN’s CEO Tim Jones used the feedback he got from various lifestyle trackers to finally reduce his genetically high cholesterol levels—and built a richer, more meaningful life in the process. Read more: <strong><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a61533885/cut-cholesterol-in-half-timothy-jones-transformation/">How This Guy Cut His Cholesterol in Half Without Drugs</a></strong>)</p>
<h3>Bad omen: Data collection is decreasing motivation or ability.</h3>
<p>When Jan, an avid recreational cyclist, found out he could view—then demolish—the records set on local biking trails, he set to work. But as those records were destroyed, so too was his ability to ride for enjoyment. His focus on speed left him under-recovered and eventually led to burnout.</p>
<p>If workouts have become more about the numbers and less about technique, experience, or even enjoyment, tracking is likely no longer helpful.</p>
<h2>Sign #3: Tracking is helping you understand yourself better.</h2>
<p>The harder you work, the better your results.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>This belief tends to get grinders like Zak into trouble because they <em>think</em> they’re making progress—but really they’re just getting in their own way, even inhibiting performance and recovery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are also many people who chronically <em>under</em>estimate their effort and capacity, and would benefit from turning up the heat. Here, <strong>data can help us more accurately understand our own potential.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as an example. HIIT workouts alternate fixed periods of intense effort with fixed periods of rest. However, these fixed periods of rest are just estimates of recovery times.</p>
<p>Heart rate data can create a more individualized picture of actual recovery needs, which may be faster or slower than you expect.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the mind says <em>yes</em> but the heart says <em>not quite yet. </em></p>
<p>A good coach does more than just simply ask for <em>more</em>. They also help keep clients out of the unproductive “junk volume” zone, where fatigue accumulates but performance doesn’t improve (and maybe even worsens).</p>
<p>By looking at real-time metrics of output, fatigue, and recovery, you can better understand yourself and your clients, and help keep everyone training and recovering efficiently.</p>
<h3>Bad omen: Over-reliance on data is making you lose touch with your own senses.</h3>
<p>When you become overly reliant on data, you risk losing touch with your own sense of how you feel, whether that’s hunger and fullness levels, energy and fatigue, or something else.</p>
<p>A relevant example is “The Great My Fitness Pal Blackout.”</p>
<p>In January of 2019, the calorie-tracking app (with a reported 200 million subscribers!) went down for a day. Pretty minor—unless you happened to be tracking your macro and caloric intake and waiting for the app to tell you exactly how much you could eat that day&#8230; which I was.</p>
<p>When the app wouldn&#8217;t load, I recognized the mild panic I felt was unhelpful. My overreliance on the app had disconnected me from my own internal signals, and without it, I felt adrift. Since then, I’ve shifted my focus to how energetic I <em>feel</em> and one of the oldest tracking technologies available: the mirror.</p>
<p>(If you feel like you’re lost without your besties—your phone and your apps—there’s a name for that. There are also ways to develop a healthier relationship with your tech. Read more: <strong><a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/what-is-nomophobia">What is nomophobia?</a></strong>)</p>
<h2>3 ways to use fitness trackers to help you make more accurate self-assessments</h2>
<p>Before we get to how to do the above, let’s talk about why assessing things by <em>feel </em>can be so important.</p>
<p>Whether it’s body fat percentage or movement speed, even supremely motivated and capable clients will experience diminishing objective results from their training.</p>
<p>The scale stops dropping, the number of plates you’re able to load on the bar plateaus, or—<em>gasp</em>—your race time even regresses.</p>
<p>Motivation based purely on progress or other extrinsic goals<sup>6</sup> will fall away during these times.</p>
<p>However, <strong>exercisers who focus on feelings of mindfulness</strong><sup>7</sup><strong>, mastery, meaning</strong><sup>8</sup><strong>, and success</strong><sup>9</sup><strong> develop a more resilient practice. </strong>They also <em>enjoy </em>the process more, whether that’s the process of running, lifting, winding down for a good night’s sleep, or just enjoying a meal.</p>
<p>So, although objective data can provide essential feedback and guidance, you’ll only reap the full benefits of your practice—that is, enjoyment <em>and </em>results—if you maintain connection with your <em>felt experience.</em></p>
<p>And good news: You can actually use fitness trackers to calibrate and even <em>improve </em>your ability to accurately sense what’s happening in your body.</p>
<p>Here are three ways to do it.</p>
<h3>1. Check in with yourself before you check the data.</h3>
<p>Can you imagine asking someone how their vacation was and then waiting for them to look at their photos to be able to answer? That’s what it’s like when you rely purely on external data about your own experience.</p>
<p>Whatever the metric—how far you biked, how many calories you consumed, or how fast your heart was beating—the simplest way to work mindfully with tracker data is to pause, breathe, and then tune into the powerful (if not always accurate) prediction-making powers of your brain.</p>
<p><strong>Once you’ve checked in with yourself, you can calibrate your self-assessment by comparing the detailed (if not always accurate) outputs of your fitness tracker. </strong></p>
<p>Over time, you may be able to narrow the gap between two.</p>
<p>(Note: Don’t forget to regularly update your app. Algorithms and data sets are regularly adjusted for better predictive accuracy.)</p>
<h3>2. Develop mental shortcuts that can occasionally stand in for objective measures.</h3>
<p>The coaches I work with regularly ask people to estimate the boundaries of their strength (such as how many reps they can do at a given weight until failure).</p>
<p>Novices are often terrible at estimating this—and regularly off the mark by five or more reps. However, the use of objective trackers can help calibrate their understanding, and most people can reduce their margin of error dramatically.</p>
<p>In theory, you might use fancy tools like accelerometers or blood lactate measurements, but our coaches just ask, “For a million dollars a rep, how many more reps do you think you could do?”</p>
<p>Though there’s nothing objective about this question, most clients are able to use the prompt as a kind of shortcut to understand maximal effort. (After all, that last rep may be worth seven figures!)</p>
<p>The question also leverages the rate of perceived exertion (RPE)—your perception of how hard you’re working—which is one of the most validated sensory-driven approaches.</p>
<p>Not everyone is automatically good at estimating RPE, but most people can improve their skills by mapping their felt experience with occasional calibration with objective data.</p>
<h3>3. Keep developing your ability to dial into your senses.</h3>
<p>Trackers have components like accelerometers, GPS, and gyroscopes to sense data about speed, distance, and more.</p>
<p>But humans are no slouches either.</p>
<p>We have…</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li><strong>Mechanoreceptors</strong> that respond to pressure, vibration, and the joint angles change</li>
<li>A <strong>vestibular system </strong>that monitors balance and angle changes</li>
<li><strong>Proprioceptors</strong> that clock the speed and rate of length-change of muscle spindles</li>
<li><strong>Thermoreceptors</strong> that register register warming or cooling</li>
<li><strong>Chemoreceptors</strong> that detect chemical changes, such as scent or taste, as well as changes in the bloodstream</li>
<li><strong>Nociceptors</strong>—part of the body’s alarm system—that sense threat and send signals of potential harm or distress</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s only a partial list.</p>
<p><strong>You have access to an incredibly rich network of sensory information—something that technology cannot begin to touch. </strong></p>
<p>All of this information is fed into the powerful pattern-recognition machine of your nervous system.</p>
<p>To continue honing your ability to <em>use </em>this rich network of sensory information, regularly check in with what and how you’re feeling.</p>
<p>When you learn to calibrate your own senses with objective data, you can leverage all the cool advances in wearable tech—while still keeping your own experience front and centre.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“I worried that if I stopped tracking macros, I would lose my physique.”</h2>
<p>After years of careful macro tracking, Dr. Fundaro finally admitted to herself that the method no longer worked for her. Yet she was afraid to give it up.</p>
<p>If anyone should feel confident in their food choices, it would be Dr. Gabrielle Fundaro. After all, Dr. Fundaro has a PhD in Human Nutrition, a decade-plus of nutrition coaching experience, and six powerlifting competitions under her belt.</p>
<p>Yet, when she was really honest with herself, Dr. Fundaro realized that she felt far from confident around food. For years, she’d used macro counting as a way to stay “on track” with her eating.</p>
<p>And it worked&#8230; until it didn’t.</p>
<p>After years of macro tracking, Dr. Fundaro was tired of the whole thing. She was tired of making sure her macros were perfectly in balance. She was sick of not being able to just pick whatever she wanted off a menu and enjoy the meal, trusting that her health and physique wouldn’t go sideways as a result.</p>
<p>Yet the idea of <em>not</em> tracking freaked her out. Every time she quit tracking, she worried:</p>
<p>“What if I don’t eat enough protein, and lose all my muscle?”</p>
<p>“What if I overeat and gain fat?”</p>
<p>“What if I have no idea how to fuel myself without tracking macros? And what does that say about me as an expert in the field of nutrition?”</p>
<h3>The more Dr. Fundaro wrestled with macro tracking, the more she wanted to find an alternative.</h3>
<p>Something that would support her nutritional goals while <em>also</em> giving her a sense of freedom and peace around food.</p>
<p>Calorie counting wouldn’t do it. That was just as restrictive as counting macros—maybe more.</p>
<p>Intuitive eating didn’t seem like a good fit either. Intuitive eating relies heavily on a person’s ability to tune into internal hunger and fullness cues to guide food choices and amounts. After years of relying on <em>external </em>cues (like her macro targets), Dr. Fundaro didn’t feel trusting enough of her own instincts; she wanted more structure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the gym, Dr. Fundaro began lifting based on the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale—a framework that helps individuals quantify the amount of effort they’re putting into a given movement or activity. It’s considered a valuable tool to help people train safely and effectively according to their ability and goals. (More on that soon.)</p>
<p>While using the RPE scale in her training, Dr. Fundaro found she was both getting stronger <em>and </em>recovering better. There was something to this combination of structure and intuition that just <em>worked.</em></p>
<p>And then, it dawned on Dr. Fundaro like the apple hit Sir Isaac Newton on the head:</p>
<h3>If Rate of Perceived Exertion could help her train better, couldn’t a similar framework help her eat better?</h3>
<p>With that, the RPE-Eating Scale was born.</p>
<p>Dr. Fundaro has since used this alternative method to help herself and her clients <strong>regain confidence and self-trust around food; improve nutritional awareness and competence; and free themselves from food tracking</strong>.</p>
<p>(Yup, Dr. Fundaro finally trusts her eating choices—no macro tracker in sight.)</p>
<p><strong>In this article, you’ll learn how she did it, <em>plus</em>: </strong></p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>What the RPE-Eating scale is</li>
<li>How to practice RPE-Eating</li>
<li>How to use RPE-Eating for weight loss or gain</li>
<li>Whether RPE-Eating is right for you or your clients</li>
<li>What to keep in mind if you’re skeptical of the concept</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is RPE-Eating?</h2>
<p>Invented by Gunnar Borg in the 1960’s, <strong>Rate of Perceived Exertion</strong> (RPE) is a scale that’s used to measure an individual’s perceived level of effort or exertion during exercise.</p>
<p>Though Borg’s RPE uses a scale that goes from 6 to 20, many modern scales use a 0 to 10 range (which is the range that Dr. Fundaro adapted for her RPE-Eating scale).</p>
<p>Here’s the RPE scale used in fitness.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rating</th>
<th>Perceived Exertion Level</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>No exertion, at rest</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Very light</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2-3</td>
<td>Light</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4-5</td>
<td>Moderate, somewhat hard</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6-7</td>
<td>High, vigorous</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8-9</td>
<td>Very hard</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>Maximum effort, highest possible</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Originally used in physiotherapy settings, the scale is now frequently used in fitness training.</p>
<p>For example, powerlifters might use it to choose how heavy they want to go during a training session. Or, pregnant women might use it to ensure they aren’t over-exerting themselves during a fitness class or strength training session.</p>
<p><strong>Because human experience is highly subjective and individual, the scale allows the exerciser to judge how hard they’re working for <em>themselves.</em> </strong>A coach can provide a general guideline, such as “aim for a 7/10 this set,” but it’s up to the client to determine exactly what that means for them.</p>
<p>Dr. Fundaro had used the scale many times with herself, and clients. She always appreciated the sense of autonomy it gave her clients, while still providing some structure.</p>
<p>So, she decided to take the same 1-10 scale and its principles, and apply it to eating.</p>
<h3 id="rpe-scale">Here’s what the RPE-Eating Scale looks like:</h3>

<p>The goal with RPE-Eating is similar to RPE when training: Develop the skills to determine what is sufficient for<em> you</em>, without having to rely on other external metrics (such as apps or trackers).</p>
<h2>How to practice RPE-Eating</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever practiced RPE-training, you’ll know it takes some time to get used to. RPE-Eating is the same.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t expect to be in lockstep with all of your body&#8217;s internal cues at first, especially if you’ve been ignoring them for a long time. </strong></p>
<p>With this in mind, apply the steps below to practice the RPE-Eating process.</p>
<h3>Step #1: Get clear on your goals.</h3>
<p><strong>RPE-Eating is not just another diet. </strong></p>
<p>“It’s not about aiming to <em>change</em> your body,” Dr. Fundaro explains. “It’s not about feeling more <em>control</em> over your diet. Nor is it about feeling like you’re eating the ‘optimal’ diet.”</p>
<p>If your priority is maintaining a specific physique (such as staying ultra lean) or changing your body (building muscle or losing fat), this method <em>can </em>be adapted for that, though it isn’t the most efficient one to use.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>RPE-Eating is about sensing into what your body needs and giving yourself appropriate nourishment—while building inner trust and confidence along the way.</strong></p>
<p>“You have to trust that you’ll be able to nourish your body, and that you’ll be okay even though things may change in your body,” says Dr. Fundaro.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this can be challenging to do. It can also be difficult to let go of the expectation that you’ll hit the “right” macros at every meal—which RPE-Eating isn’t specifically designed to do.</p>
<p>However, <strong>if your goal is to build more self-trust, RPE-Eating can be a great tool to help you do that.</strong></p>
<h3>Step #2: Practice identifying your hunger cues</h3>
<p>Before we explore this step, let’s distinguish between two motivators for eating.</p>
<p>First, there’s <strong>hunger</strong>. Hunger occurs when <em>physical cues</em> in your body (like a general sense of emptiness or rumbling in your stomach, or lightheadedness) tells you that you require energy—known to us mortals as food.</p>
<p>Then, there’s <strong>appetite.</strong> Appetite is our <em>desire or interest </em>in eating. It can stay peaked even after hunger is quelled, especially if something looks or tastes especially delicious—like a warm, gooey cookie offered after dinner that you feel you <em>have </em>to try, even though you’re technically full.</p>
<p>While it’s normal to eat for both hunger <em>and </em>appetite drives, the two can become mixed up. Especially if we have a history of dieting and tracking food.</p>
<p><strong>The RPE-Eating scale helps you tap back into those true physical hunger cues, and learn the difference between hunger and appetite.</strong></p>
<p>To put this in practice, try this before your next meal:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Using the <a href="#rpe-scale">RPE-Eating scale mentioned above</a>, <strong>identify your current level of hunger. </strong>Record the number on paper or the notes app on your phone.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Then, <strong>eat your meal with as much presence as possible.</strong> (Note: This in itself takes practice. It can help to limit distractions, such as eating at the table rather than in front of the TV, and focusing on the flavors and textures of the food you’re eating, and how you feel eating it.)</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> About halfway through the meal, <strong>check in again.</strong> Based on the scale, how hungry are you now? As before, record the number.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you’re still hungry, finish your meal. When you’re finished, repeat the same process, writing down where you are on the scale.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Once you’re done, take a minute and tune into what your body feels like. <strong>What does it feel like to be full? </strong>“Download” that feeling into your mind and internalize it in your body, as if you’re updating your phone with the latest software.</p>
<p>Repeat this for as many meals as you can. Aim to do it for one meal a day for a week or so, or for as long as feels good to you. Don’t worry if you forget: simply repeat the practice when you can.</p>
<p>The more you practice this, the better you’ll become at being attuned with your actual hunger cues. With time, you’ll likely find you develop more trust in your internal compass than what the latest diet tracker says for your needs.</p>
<p>(For more on fully-tuned-in, mindful eating, read: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/30-day-eating-challenge">The benefits of slow eating</a>.)</p>
<h3>Step #3: Get to know your non-hunger triggers</h3>
<p>Have you ever come home after a super stressful day and you’ve basically thrown yourself onto a bag of chips or a carton of ice cream?</p>
<p>We might like to imagine ourselves eating every meal mindfully, using the RPE- Eating system to a tee, but life rarely works like that.</p>
<p>Chances are, <strong>there are certain situations that trigger you to eat more quickly, mindlessly, and beyond the point of hunger. </strong></p>
<p>That’s okay.</p>
<p>Dr. Fundaro’s suggestion? <strong>Aim to become more aware of the situations that cause you to overeat in the first place. </strong></p>
<p>To do this, you can practice something we use in PN Coaching: Notice and name.</p>
<p>When you find yourself scarfing down food faster than you can blink, simply try to notice what’s going on.</p>
<p>Can you name a feeling—such as anxiety, or sadness?</p>
<p>Can you identify a situation or moment that happened before you started eating—say, an argument with your teenager, or a nasty email from your boss?</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified the feeling, event, or person that’s triggered you to eat compulsively, <strong>see if you can also identify what you might <em>really </em>be needing or desiring.</strong></p>
<p>Eating for comfort is <em>normal.</em> However, if it’s the only coping method we have, it can cause more problems than it solves in the long run.</p>
<p>When you find yourself with an urge to eat mindlessly, consider what non-food coping mechanisms might help you feel better. That could be 10 minutes away from your computer to close your eyes and breathe, a walk outside, or a quick call to a friend to rant—or just talk about something completely unrelated.</p>
<p>Getting to know your non-hunger eating triggers—plus widening your repertoire of self-soothing methods—is just as valuable as getting to know your hunger cues. Over time, this awareness will allow you to eat with more intention.</p>
<h3>Step #4: Eat for satiety AND satisfaction</h3>
<p><strong>Even when you’re “adequately fueled” from a physical perspective, you might still feel unsatisfied from an emotional perspective. </strong></p>
<p>That’s because, according to the RPE-Eating framework, eating should fulfill two criteria:</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Satiety </strong>describes the physical sensation of being full; your calorie or fuel needs are met.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Satisfaction</strong> describes a more holistic feeling of being nourished; your calorie needs are met, but your meal also felt <em>pleasurable</em>.</p>
<p>If you ate to satiety only, your calorie needs might be met and your physical hunger quelled, but you might still feel unsatisfied—maybe because chocolate is on your “don’t” list, and even though you’ve eaten everything else in your kitchen that <em>isn’t </em>chocolate, nothing quite “hit the spot.”</p>
<p>In other words, you can eat to satiety at every meal, yet still be “restricting” foods.</p>
<p>You may not be restricting calories per se, but you may have banned entire food groups—baked goods, pizza, or whatever else curls your toes. This can lead to a feeling of constantly needing to police yourself, and doesn’t leave much room for the flexibility and spontaneity that real-life (enjoyable) eating requires.</p>
<p>(Plus, avoiding particular foods tends to work like a pendulum: restrict now; binge later. If you want to learn how to stop those wild swings, read: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/how-to-eat-junk-food">How to eat junk food: A guide for conflicted humans</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Satisfaction is a key part of eating. </strong></p>
<p>After all, humans don’t just eat for adequate nutrients and energy. We eat for other reasons too: pleasure, novelty, tradition, community, enjoyment.</p>
<p>So, to take your RPE-Eating to the next level, Dr. Fundaro recommends trying it with meals and foods you genuinely enjoy.</p>
<p>If any foods or meals have been “off-limits,” try eating them using the RPE technique. (Macaroni and cheese, anyone?)</p>
<p>Practice using the scale with a variety of meals (including those you may have restricted previously), and notice how you feel over time.</p>
<p>With experience, you’ll get to know what it feels like to adequately fuel yourself with a variety of foods—including those you genuinely enjoy.</p>

<h2>How do I know if RPE-Eating is right for me or my clients?</h2>
<p>RPE-Eating isn’t for everyone, but might be a good fit for you (or your clients) if:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You feel dependent on food tracking, but you don’t want to be.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Every time you stop tracking, the loss of perceived control freaks you out and drives you right back to tracking.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You want to stop tracking, but you want to have some type of system or guidance in place.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You’re currently tracking (or considering tracking) your food intake, <em>and</em> you have elevated risk factors for developing an eating disorder such as high body dissatisfaction; a history of yo-yo dieting; a history of disordered eating patterns; and/or participation in weight class sports.</p>
<p>If you’re a coach looking to use this tool with a client, check out <a href="https://linktr.ee/Vitaminphd">Dr. Fundaro’s resources</a>. Remember this tool may not be for everyone, and how you apply it needs to be flexible.</p>
<p>Note: If you or your client struggles with disordered eating, this tool does not replace working with a health professional who specializes in eating disorders, such as a therapist, doctor, or registered dietician.</p>
<p></div>
<h2>How to use RPE- Eating for weight loss or weight gain</h2>
<p>According to Dr. Fundaro, the best way to use RPE-Eating is in a weight-neutral setting.</p>
<p>While it <em>could</em> be used for weight modification, she doesn’t recommend treating it as another way to hit your macros or “goal weight.”</p>
<p>“I’m not <em>anti</em>-weight modification,” Dr. Fundaro explains. “I’m pro <em>safe</em> weight modification. I compare weight loss to contact sports. There are inherent risks but they can be mitigated through best practices.”</p>
<p>Dr. Fundaro elaborates: “Since RPE-Eating removes macro-tracking, which can increase risk of disordered eating in some people, and relies on biofeedback and non-hunger triggers, RPE-Eating provides a safety net that macro-tracking alone doesn’t provide.”</p>
<p><strong>But if you <em>do </em>want to use RPE-Eating for intentional weight change, what should you do? </strong></p>
<p>Dr. Fundaro recommends aiming to hover around the ranges that support your goal.</p>
<p>(<a href="#rpe-scale">As a reminder</a>, a 1 to 3 on the RPE-Eating scale is categorized as “inadequate fuel; a 4 to 7 is categorized as &#8220;adequate fuel”; and a 8 to 10 is categorized as “excess fuel.”)</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If the goal is weight gain,</strong> you’ll likely aim to eat within the 7 to 8 range for most of your meals.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If the goal is weight loss,</strong> you’ll likely aim to eat within the 4 to 5 range for most of your meals.</p>
<p>A key thing to remember is that you would never use RPE-Eating for extreme weight-modification such as for a bodybuilding competition. “That would be like using physio exercises to prepare for a powerlifting competition.” In other words, it’s not the right tool for the job.</p>
<h2>Hold up, bro: Isn’t this just feelings over facts?</h2>
<p>If you’re skeptical and think this is just eating “based on your feelings,” keep in mind that RPE was once laughed at by lifters, too.</p>
<p>These days, RPE and autoregulation are widely accepted in gym culture and have been studied as a valid method for managing and guiding your training. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>RPE isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty accurate and incredibly convenient. A lot more convenient than, say, using a velocity loss tracker for every set. <sup>2 3</sup></p>
<p>And while it might seem like it’s all feelings-based, the RPE scale is actually built around practicing the skill of <strong>interoceptive awareness</strong>—the awareness of internal sensations in your body.</p>
<p>The better you get at the skill of interoceptive awareness, the more you’ll be able to use that awareness to make informed decisions about your training.</p>
<p>RPE-Eating is similar: It builds the skill of sensing into your own body, and lets your internal sensations guide your decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Similar to how the bar slowing down on a squat would indicate you’re getting closer to failure, experiencing the absence of hunger at the end of your meal would indicate you’re closer to being full. </strong></p>
<p>Instead of tracking your glucose levels to validate your perceived hunger, you use internal cues that correlate with lowered blood sugar and coincide with hunger.</p>
<p>And, let’s be real: Being mindful of stomach grumbling or general hunger pangs is much more convenient and accessible than tracking glucose readings.</p>
<p>This process will not be perfect. You may undereat or overeat at first. But over time, with practice, you’ll build the core skills of RPE-Eating.</p>
<h2>Are there downsides to RPE-Eating?</h2>
<p>While this tool can be helpful, it’s just a tool. A screwdriver is great, but it isn’t useful when you need a hammer.</p>
<p>RPE-Eating can be great for helping you become more aware of your internal hunger cues and build a better relationship with food along the way.</p>
<p><strong>It can also be more laborious. It requires paying real attention to your feelings (physical and emotional), and reflecting on them. </strong></p>
<p>This can be difficult for anyone—but especially people who aren’t able to sit at the table and have a leisurely meal, like parents with small kids, or people with work schedules that require eating on-the-go.</p>
<p>If this is you, just <strong>use RPE-Eating when it <em>does</em> work for you—or simply pick and choose specific steps to use in isolation.</strong> For example, maybe you try RPE-Eating on the occasional quiet lunch break. Or, maybe you focus solely on developing your awareness of hunger and fullness cues, without trying to change anything else.</p>
<h2>If you’ve been tracking macros for a long time, it can be hard to stop.</h2>
<p>Tracking macros isn’t inherently bad. It can actually be a helpful tool to teach you more about nutrition. But it’s also not something most people want to do for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>The problem is, if you’ve depended on tracking your food intake, stopping can feel scary.</p>
<p>In these cases, <strong>RPE-Eating can be used as a kind of off-ramp to help transition away from rigid and restrictive macro tracking. </strong></p>
<p>(It can also help loosen the compulsion to “always finish your plate.” Though macros tracking and habitual plate-cleaning may sound different, they’re actually similar: both rely on external cues—such as macro targets or what’s served on your plate—to determine when you’re “done.”)</p>
<p>RPE-Eating won’t take away all the scary feelings that may come with changing ingrained ways of eating.</p>
<p>However, it can provide some structure and language to help you, or your clients, eat with less fear, less stress, and a bit more confidence.</p>
<p>“The goal,” says Dr. Fundaro, “is to know that you’re nourishing yourself—and you don&#8217;t need a food tracker to do that.”</p>

<hr class="top" />
<h2>It’s like my thoughts were under a pile of garbage.</h2>
<p>On a Friday night, as my husband and I tried to figure out where to eat, a typical conversation would go like this:</p>
<p>Me: Do you want to go to that restaurant?</p>
<p>Him: What restaurant?</p>
<p>Me: I can’t think of the name. We’ve eaten there before. It’s that place with the peanut shells on the floor? It’s next to&#8230; You know… It’s on that road where we used to take the dog to the vet. Do you know the one I’m talking about??</p>
<p>It was as if certain details got lost in a pile of sludge in the deep recesses of my brain. Then, hours later, the details would escape, and I’d shout into an empty room…</p>
<p>“Texas Roadhouse!”</p>
<h3>Sludginess with proper nouns is typical for people who are middle-aged and beyond.</h3>
<p>However, what seemed to be happening to me, increasingly in my late 40s and early 50s, felt far from typical.</p>
<p>Not only could I never seem to spit out the names of various restaurants or people or books or movies or so many other things, but my brain was also pooping out during the workday.</p>
<p>I’d sit in front of my computer screen, stare at a document, and will myself to do something constructive with my fingertips. Everything seemed hazy, like those first few moments in the morning when you’re awake enough to turn off the alarm but too sleepy to do basic math.</p>
<p>I had my good moments, usually in the morning, when I attempted to pack eight hours of writing into the two or three hours I possessed mental clarity.</p>
<p><strong>On my worst days, however, I awoke with a haze I never managed to shake. </strong>Work was a non-starter. Nor did I have enough bandwidth to read, or do much of anything, really.</p>
<h3>I sought medical advice.</h3>
<p>Three healthcare professionals recommended antidepressants. I tried one, and felt even worse. I tried another. I tried yet another at a higher dose. Still, I felt like a zombie. Another professional gave me a sleeping pill. It left me feeling even more drugged.</p>
<p>Someone tested my thyroid. There was nothing wrong with it. Nor was I anemic. I tried supplements, mushroom coffee, and just about any product with the word “think” somewhere on its label.</p>
<p>Finally, after nearly two years of seeing a revolving door of doctors, I made an appointment with a gynecologist for my yearly exam. I mentioned vaginal dryness. That information triggered her to ask a string of questions that had nothing to do with my undercarriage. How was my sleep? Mood? Energy levels? Was I experiencing hot flashes? How about brain fog?</p>
<p><strong>“Funny you should mention brain fog,” I said in my usual hazy monotone. “I feel like I’m barely alive.”</strong></p>
<p>By the end of the visit, I understood that I’d likely never had depression.</p>
<h3>What I “had” was menopause.</h3>
<p>My gynecologist sent me home with prescriptions for estradiol and progesterone.</p>
<p>Within days, it was as if someone had flipped a switch.</p>
<p>I could think again. I could type words again. I could follow conversations. I could work past noon.</p>
<p>And, for the first time in years, I could sleep more than two hours without waking.</p>
<h2>Now, menopause isn’t a medical condition.</h2>
<p>Nor is it a disease.</p>
<p><strong>Instead, like puberty, it’s a life stage—a transitional moment to be precise. </strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve gone 12 consecutive months without a period, you’ve reached menopause. And from that moment onwards, you’re officially “postmenopausal.”</p>
<p>As women approach this transitional moment, hormone levels fluctuate and fall, triggering dozens of symptoms. <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/menopause-weight-gain">Weight gain</a> and reduced sex drive get a lot of attention.<sup id="fnref3"></sup></p>
<p>However, <strong>during and after menopause, roughly 40 percent of women report increased irritability, mood swings, anxiety, fatigue, and trouble concentrating,</strong> according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.<sup>1 2</sup> As the following image shows, it’s also one of the most vulnerable times in a woman’s life to develop depression,<sup>3</sup> particularly if they’ve struggled in the past with it before.</p>

<p>Before starting hormones, I often found myself sobbing for no reason. Other times, the world’s stimuli felt too… stimulating.</p>
<p>Normal everyday sounds—like the buzz of traffic or people at the mall—literally <em>hurt</em>. I was jumpy and irritable and felt anxious about situations that had never bothered me in the past, such as driving over bridges or through construction.</p>
<h3>It’s not completely clear what drives these cognitive and emotional symptoms.</h3>
<p>Fluctuating hormone levels likely play a role, as do typical age-related changes in the brain.</p>
<p>In addition, during this stage of life, women often deal with several issues that siphon cognitive capacity faster than a thirsty vampire drains a carotid.</p>
<p>During their 40s and 50s, for example, many women have reached the peak of their careers, with responsibilities that follow them home and keep them up at night. They may also be parenting angst-filled teens, caring for aging parents, adjusting to an empty nest, questioning their marriage, or trying to wrap their bank account around the latest statement from the college bursar or hospital billing department.</p>
<p>However, <strong>one of the lesser-known and talked about triggers for cognitive discontent has nothing to do with aging or life stress and everything to do with that hallmark menopausal symptom: the hot flash. </strong></p>
<h2>Anatomy of a hot flash</h2>
<p>Hot flashes, which happen during the day, and night sweats, which occur at night, fall under the category of <strong>vasomotor symptoms</strong>. (The word “vasomotor” refers to the constriction or dilation of blood vessels which, in turn, can influence everything from blood pressure to sweating.)</p>
<p>During a hot flash or night sweat, norepinephrine and cortisol levels rise. Blood vessels dilate in an attempt to shed heat. Blood pressure and heart rate increase.</p>
<p>Depending on the severity of the hot flash, your skin might redden as sensations of warmth spread through your face, neck, and chest.</p>
<p>You might sweat, experience heart palpitations, or feel anxious, tired, or faint.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear why hot flashes crop up around menopause.</p>
<p>According to one theory, falling estrogen levels affect the <strong>hypothalamus</strong>, the area of the brain involved in temperature regulation. The brain’s internal thermostat gets wonky and occasionally thinks your body is too hot or cold (when it’s not).</p>
<h2>How vasomotor symptoms change the brain</h2>
<p>For many years, experts thought of vasomotor symptoms as mere inconveniences or sources of embarrassment.</p>
<p>(To be honest, so did I. During all of those fruitless visits to various healthcare professionals, it never occurred to me to mention them.)</p>
<p>However, an increasing body of research has revealed that hot flashes may do more than make us uncomfortable or force us to change our sheets in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>They may also affect our blood vessels and brains—and not for the better.<sup>5</sup> For this reason, <strong>an increasing number of experts now consider vasomotor symptoms to be a treatable medical condition.</strong><sup>6 7 8</sup></p>
<h3>Hot flashes and brain lesions</h3>
<p>In one study, researchers asked 226 women to wear monitors that tracked when they were experiencing a hot flash. The women also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), filled out sleep diaries, and wore smartwatches that recorded how often they woke at night.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>As researchers looked at the brain images obtained from women who experienced the most hot flashes, they noticed an abundance of patchy areas called <strong>whole-brain white matter intensities.</strong></p>
<p>These lesions were once thought of as a typical consequence of aging. However, neuroscientists now believe that the presence of whole-brain white matter intensities is predictive of future cognitive decline.</p>
<p>People with an abundance of these brain lesions are twice as likely to get diagnosed with dementia and three times as likely to have a future stroke.<sup>10</sup></p>
<h3>The blood vessel connection</h3>
<p>It’s thought that the increased presence of whole-brain white matter intensities may stem, in part, from changes taking place in the blood vessels that feed the brain.</p>
<p>A three-year study of 492 women supports that theory. It determined that <strong>women who experienced frequent hot flashes also tended to experience unhealthy changes in their blood vessels</strong>, such as an inability to dilate to accommodate increased blood flow.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Other research has linked frequent hot flashes with increases in the following:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Thickening in the carotid arteries that supply blood to the brain, face, and neck<sup>12</sup></li>
<li>Body fat</li>
<li>Total and LDL cholesterol</li>
<li>Insulin resistance<sup>13 14 15 16</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3>The sleep connection</h3>
<p>In addition to directly affecting the blood vessels, frequent hot flashes may also affect the brain by disturbing sleep.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Interestingly,<strong> many women don’t necessarily know that hot flashes are disturbing their sleep. </strong></p>
<p>They may instead—as I did—assume they have insomnia or sleep apnea.</p>
<p>That’s because night sweats aren’t always sweaty.</p>
<p>By the time a surge in cortisol and norepinephrine jolts a woman awake, the hotness of the flash may have dissipated. So, it can feel as if she’s repeatedly waking, over and over and over again, for no discernable reason.</p>
<p><strong>These frequent awakenings may interfere with the brain’s ability to consolidate memories, metabolize toxins, and store all the names, dates, and facts one encounters daily. </strong></p>
<p>It can also lead to lost connectivity in the <strong>hippocampus</strong>, a part of the brain that’s important for learning and memory.</p>
<p>Sleep loss also means the <strong>amygdala</strong>, a part of the brain involved in emotion, becomes more reactive, causing people to feel more easily stressed, anxious, irritable, frustrated, or enraged.<sup>18 19</sup></p>
<p>All of these brain changes can set in after just days to a week of lost sleep. So, imagine what happens when you’ve been waking over and over again—for years.</p>
<h2>Why it can be hard to get help</h2>
<p>To diagnose depression, healthcare professionals use a tool called the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale. If you check off four of the nine symptoms on the scale, you’re considered depressed.</p>
<p>However, four of the symptoms on the checklist also overlap with the symptoms of menopause-related sleep deprivation:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Little interest or pleasure in doing things</li>
<li>Trouble falling or staying asleep</li>
<li>Feeling tired or having little energy</li>
<li>Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television</li>
</ul>
<p>Check off those four items, and you might be diagnosed with depression, even if what&#8217;s <em>really </em>ailing you is the battle with sleep you&#8217;ve been waging since you turned 47.</p>
<h3>A lack of menopause-specific training</h3>
<p>Another problem: On surveys, <strong>80 percent of medical residents admit they feel “barely comfortable” talking about menopause.</strong><sup>20</sup> In addition, few residency programs—including ob-gyn residency programs—offer training in it.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>Given the above, it’s no wonder so many healthcare professionals never think to ask about hot flashes or sleep disturbances when people like me show up complaining of fatigue, lack of gumption, and an inability to focus.</p>
<p>In addition, even when it’s clear that vasomotor symptoms are leading to cognitive and emotional symptoms, <strong>many healthcare professionals still shy away from prescribing menopausal hormone therapy </strong>(also called hormone replacement therapy, or HRT), often telling women that supplemental hormones are “not safe” or “too risky.”</p>
<p>These professionals are practicing what Michigan-based menopause-trained gynecologist Jerrold H. Weinberg, MD, calls “defensive medicine.”</p>
<p>“It’s one of the first reflexes doctors have when they recommend a treatment,” says Dr. Weinberg. “They worry they’re going to get sued.”</p>
<h3>What the research <em>actually </em>says about hormone therapy</h3>
<p>These worries are based on research done several decades ago that linked the use of certain types of hormones with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer or stroke.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>However, according to more recent research, that small increased risk seems to depend on several other factors, such as age, dose, the type of hormonal preparation, and the duration of hormone use.<sup>23 24</sup></p>
<p>As long as you’re younger than 60 and have been postmenopausal for fewer than 10 years, <strong>many experts now say the benefits outweigh the risks for women with moderate to severe menopausal symptoms.</strong><sup>25</sup></p>
<p>It’s also counterbalanced by health <em>benefits </em>such as reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or osteoporosis, says Dr. Weinberg, who confirms the health benefits of menopause hormone therapy far outweigh the risks for most women.</p>
<p>Because some antidepressants can lift mood, improve sleep, and reduce hot flashes, some healthcare professionals turn to them instead of menopause hormone therapy. As with any medicine, antidepressants have their own list of side effects. However, for someone practicing defensive medicine, they often seem like a safer bet, says Dr. Weinberg.<sup>26 27 28</sup></p>
<h2>How to advocate for your health</h2>
<p>If you or your client are on what seems like a never-ending quest to find a healthcare professional who understands menopause, use the following advice from Dr. Weinberg and Helen Kollias, PhD, an expert on physiology and molecular biology and science advisor at Precision Nutrition and Girls Gone Strong.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Seek care from a menopause-trained health professional</strong>.</p>
<p>Usually, these professionals list this training and interest in their bio. For example, they might list “menopause” as an area of focus.</p>
<p>You can also search <a href="https://portal.menopause.org/NAMS/NAMS/Directory/Menopause-Practitioner.aspx">this database </a>for practitioners who have earned a certification from the Menopause Society.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Document your symptoms</strong>.</p>
<p>Write them down. That way, if you feel foggy or nervous during your appointment, you can lean on your notes.</p>
<p>This information can also help you judge whether MHT or another medicine is working. Based on your symptom data, you and your healthcare professional may decide to switch to a different medicine or change your dose.</p>
<p>Consider tracking:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>How often you get hot flashes</li>
<li>The number of hours in a typical day you find yourself battling brain fog</li>
<li>How often you experience fatigue, anxiety, rage, or some other symptom</li>
<li>How often you wake up at night</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Be as specific as you can during your appointment. </strong></p>
<p>Saying something like “I don’t sleep well,” is less likely to get you the right kind of help than saying, “During the past seven days, I’ve only gotten four uninterrupted hours once. I wake, on average, five times a night. On a typical night, my longest stretch of sleep is three hours.”</p>
<p>If you use a smartwatch, come ready to fire up your health app, so your healthcare professional can see the data.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Talk about the pros and cons of treatment</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s a concept in medicine known as “shared decision-making.” Part of that process involves frank discussions about the benefits and risks of a given treatment. Then, patients and clinicians work together to make decisions based on those benefits and risks.</p>
<p>Many healthcare networks encourage clinicians to use shared decision-making, as it seems to reduce patient complaints as well as malpractice lawsuits.<sup>29 30</sup></p>
<p>For this reason, shared decision-making can help shift a healthcare professional out of the “defensive medicine” mindset.</p>
<p>You might ask questions like:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>“I’m interested in seeing if menopausal hormone therapy might be helpful. Could we discuss if I’m a good candidate?”</li>
<li>“I’ve read that menopausal hormone therapy could slightly increase my risk of breast cancer. Could you help me understand my personal breast cancer risk based on my family history, age, body weight, and lifestyle?”</li>
<li>“Osteoporosis runs in my family, as does dementia. I’ve heard that menopausal hormone therapy might help to reduce the risk for both, in addition to helping me sleep. Could you help me weigh the pros and cons?”</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to improve mental and emotional health during menopause: 9 lifestyle strategies</h2>
<p>The lifestyle habits that improve mental and emotional health during menopause aren’t terribly different from the lifestyle habits that improve overall health—for any person, at any stage of life.</p>
<p><strong>Other than avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and spicy or hot foods, there’s no special diet for people with vasomotor symptoms.</strong> (And by the way, tofu and other soy products don’t seem to help with vasomotor symptoms as much as once thought<sup>30</sup>—though they’re still nutritious.)</p>
<h3>Strategy #1: Lean into fundamental health strategies.</h3>
<p>Healthy behaviors don’t necessarily change during middle age.</p>
<p>Nutrition, physical activity, stress management, sleep, social connectedness, and a sense of purpose matter just as much during the menopausal transition as they do when we’re younger. However, these fundamentals are even more important to dial in as life progresses.</p>
<p>So consider:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Are you setting aside enough time for sleep and rest?</li>
<li>Are you physically active?</li>
<li>Are you eating a diet that’s mostly minimally processed and full of brightly colored produce, healthy fats, lean protein, fibrous vegetables, and legumes?</li>
<li>Do you regularly connect with other humans in ways that help you buffer stress and feel supported?</li>
<li>Do you find ways to experience awe, joy, curiosity, peace, and purpose?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered “no” to some or all of those questions, consider why that is. What’s stopping you? How might you remove barriers or shore up support to make those fundamentals easier?</p>
<h3>Strategy #2: Experiment with creatine.</h3>
<p>In addition to helping to blunt age- and hormone-related losses in muscle and bone mass, creatine may also help bolster mood and brain function while reducing mental fatigue.</p>
<p>It also seems to counter some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation. <sup>32 33</sup> Research shows a daily dose of 5 to 7 grams of creatine monohydrate is effective.</p>
<h3>Strategy #3: Get regular about light exposure.</h3>
<p>In addition to helping you feel alert, sunlight helps to set the internal clock in your brain that makes you sleepy at night and spunky in the morning. Morning and late afternoon light exposure seem particularly potent.</p>
<p>In a study of 103 people, exposure to morning sunlight predicted better sleep quality the following night. When people spent time outdoors in the mornings, they fell asleep more quickly, slept longer, and experienced fewer awakenings the following evening.<sup>34</sup></p>
<p>Sunlight may also improve mood and concentration.<sup>35</sup></p>
<h3>Strategy #4: Go easier at the gym.</h3>
<p>If you’re already worn out, long, intense exercise sessions will likely make you feel worse.</p>
<p>For one, injuries crop up much more easily at middle age than during our 20s and 30s. In addition, it takes longer to recover between sessions.<sup>36</sup></p>
<p>String too many overly zealous workouts too close together, and you’ll not only likely start to feel achy but also more irritable, tense, and tired.</p>
<p><strong>However, much like a cold shower, short bursts of exercise may help you to feel alert during the day. </strong></p>
<p>If you’re falling asleep at your desk, encourage yourself to take short movement breaks such as a 5- or 10-minute walk outdoors or a quick set of pushups or squats.</p>
<p>In addition, you may find gentle exercise—such as yoga or stretching—helps you relax before bed. Just don’t make it too intense, or you’ll trigger a release of adrenaline.</p>
<p><strong>Whenever you exercise, tune into how your body feels, especially after a particularly bad night of sleep.</strong></p>
<p>We’re not saying you should never exercise vigorously or try to beat your lifting PRs. However, depending on your sleep and recovery, you might want to pare things back, especially if you’ve traditionally hit the gym hard.</p>
<p>You can still do intense sessions—just balance them out with more moderate sessions, as well as proportionate recovery.</p>
<p>Depending on how you feel, you might decide to go all out, as usual.</p>
<p>However, you might also decide to do a <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/zone-2-cardio">zone 2 training session</a> instead of an intense run. Or, if you’re resistance training, you might still do your planned session, but reduce the number of sets, reps, or volume lifted.</p>
<h3>Strategy #5: Investigate Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).</h3>
<p>This research-based therapy for insomnia can help you develop skills and mental reframes that encourage sound sleep.</p>
<p>For example, a CBT-I therapist will help you develop the skill of getting up at the same time every day, regardless of how badly you slept (or didn’t sleep) the night before.</p>
<p>(Read more: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/how-to-get-better-sleep">Three CBT-I skills that can transform how you sleep</a>.)</p>
<h3>Strategy #6: Get real about stress.</h3>
<p>You may not have the energy (or desire) to do <em>everything </em>you did when you were younger. (When you were 36, your daily checklist defied time and space.)</p>
<p>As a result, you might benefit from looking critically at your current responsibilities to see which ones you can shrink or downsize. For several days, track how you spend your time and bandwidth. Then, analyze your data.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Is this how you truly want to spend your time and energy?</li>
<li>Does your current schedule allow you to rest, recover, and tend to your own needs? Or, do you spend nearly all of your time and energy caring for and providing for others?</li>
<li>What changes could you make to prioritize rest and recovery?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a coach, use the <a href="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2019/09/Wheel-of-Stress-fillable-V4-2019.pdf">Wheel of Stress Assessment</a> to help clients identify different dimensions of their life that might be draining their mental and emotional capacity. (When you know specifically <em>where </em>your stress is coming from, you have a better chance of resolving it.)</p>
<p>If it’s demands from other people that prevent you from prioritizing self-care and recovery, you might like to read: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/how-to-put-yourself-first">How saying “no” can seriously change your life</a>.</p>
<h3>Strategy #7: Experiment with cooling technology.</h3>
<p>You might find you sleep better and experience fewer night sweats if you sleep in a cooler environment.</p>
<p>Try turning down the thermostat a couple of degrees, using a fan, or investing in an electric cooling mattress pad.</p>
<h3>Strategy #8: Take frequent breaks.</h3>
<p>When you feel the fog take over your brain, it’s not likely you’ll be doing “your best work” anyway.</p>
<p>So, for a block of time—say, 20 minutes—permit yourself to do nothing. You might:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Relax with a cold beverage</li>
<li>Cuddle with a pet</li>
<li>Gaze out a window</li>
<li>Sit outdoors while listening to the birds</li>
<li>Call a friend</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you need a quick “refresh,” you can also try a 5-minute mind-body scan. </strong></p>
<p>Get your body into a comfortable position. For example, you might use the yoga “legs up the wall” pose or lie down and place a pillow under your knees.</p>
<p>Then, close your eyes and bring your attention to physical sensations in your body. Start at your head, and work your way down to your toes.</p>
<p>Don’t judge or rush to change anything. Just observe, like a scientist. You can also scan your mind, for example, by noticing thoughts.</p>
<p>When you’ve completed the scan, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are you feeling physically?</li>
<li>What are you feeling emotionally?</li>
<li>What are you thinking?</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to “do” anything with the information you uncover, just notice.</p>
<h3>Strategy #9: Follow a diet that promotes healthy circulation.</h3>
<p>The foods that protect the blood vessels around your heart can also protect the blood vessels in your brain.</p>
<p>For example, both the MIND and Mediterranean diets are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and depression.<sup>37 38</sup> These eating patterns are rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, olives, beans, fish, and other minimally-processed whole foods.</p>
<p>In addition, nitrate-rich foods like beets and dark, leafy greens may help to dilate blood vessels, temporarily improving memory by helping more blood to reach the brain.<sup>39 40</sup></p>

<h2>The upside of menopause</h2>
<p>It’s frustrating when you feel like you can’t do it all.</p>
<p>Believe me. I know.</p>
<p><strong>However, this stage of life presents a hidden opportunity, forcing you to re-evaluate what’s most important. </strong></p>
<p>Before going on hormones, as my ability to type coherent words and phrases diminished, I was forced to ask an important question:</p>
<p><strong>Do I <em>really </em>need to be doing this?</strong></p>
<p>It was more of an existential question than a career-related one, and it allowed me to reassess how I wanted to spend my limited mental resources.</p>
<p>Given that I was self-employed, I didn’t actually <em>need</em> to be working eight hours a day. That was a gift, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Maybe I also didn’t need to cook dinner six nights out of seven. Maybe the recipes I chose could be simplified, too.</p>
<p>Finally, maybe saying “no” a lot more often and without regret would allow me to continue to say yes to the things that mattered most.</p>
<p>Things like visiting my aging parents.</p>
<p>And picking up the phone whenever my kid called from college.</p>
<p>Or meeting a friend for a meandering walk around town.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hormones and life tweaks, I now have energy again. I’m also clear-headed most of the time. However, I still tend to end my work day around 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I can, and I want to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“I work with coaches and other people who know too much.”</h2>
<p>Kate Solovieva is a former professor of psychology, a PN master coach, and PN’s director of community engagement.</p>
<p>And the above quote has become one of her taglines.</p>
<p>Though Coach Kate has coached thousands of “regular” clients, her specialty is coaching other coaches.</p>
<p>Through her work as an instructor with <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/nutrition-certification-level-2-presale-list">PN’s Level 2 Master Health Coaching Certification</a>, a facilitator for PN’s private online coaching communities, and a coach in her own private practice, she gets a front-row view of all the questions and challenges both new and seasoned coaches have.</p>
<p>Coach Kate knows what other coaches are <em>up to.</em></p>
<p>She’s seen the victories <em>and </em>the blunders of thousands of coaches, and today, she’ll share three common mistakes she sees them making.</p>
<p>If there’s anything Coach Kate wants, it’s to see her peers achieve wild success, so her hope with this article is to help coaches:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Stop feeling paralyzed by insecurity and doubt—and start growing their business</li>
<li>Learn to see their clients more objectively, so they can best serve their needs and goals</li>
<li>Clearly identify their responsibilities as a coach (hint: they&#8217;re’ not what many coaches think they are)</li>
<li>Harness their natural passion and investment in a client’s success—without burning <em>themselves </em>out</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll cover three common coaching mistakes, plus the solutions to overcome them. Let’s get into it.</p>
<h2>Coaching mistake #1: Focusing on coaching instead of selling</h2>
<p>Coach Kate describes a coaching business as a three-legged stool.</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>There’s the<strong> coaching leg</strong> (which is your skills and knowledge as a coach),</li>
<li>A <strong>selling leg</strong> (which is your ability to market and attract a flow of clients), and</li>
<li>An <strong>administrative leg</strong> (which includes how clients book appointments, make payments, and other organizing tools and systems).</li>
</ul>
<p>“The vast majority of folks who get into coaching start with the coaching leg,” says Kate.</p>
<p>“They want to become the best coach they can be, which is amazing. However, to become the best coach you can be, information and theory only get you so far.”</p>
<p>As Kate says, “You cannot become the best coach you can be in a vacuum, talking to yourself in your office.”</p>
<p>Which is why she suggests challenging the desire many coaches have to wait until their knowledge is “complete.”</p>
<p>Instead, she suggests, just start selling.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>Coaches who start selling sooner <em>also </em>get to start coaching sooner. </strong></p>
<p>Over time, they’ll have an advantage over the coaches who want to be “the BEST coach they can be” by getting 12 certifications <em>before </em>selling their services.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the coach who “doesn’t really know what they’re doing” but has started practicing anyway will begin building their business <em>and </em>their coaching experience—and likely improve their odds of overall success.</p>
<h3>Solution: Remember to show up as a COACH, not an EXPERT</h3>
<p>There’s a natural inclination among aspiring coaches who want to do a good job to get those 12 certifications <em>before </em>they start coaching.</p>
<p>“Sometimes we hold on to this hope that we’ll get to a point where we feel confident enough at fielding any question that ever comes our way,” Kate says.</p>
<p>Because as every coach knows, when you start telling people what you do, they’ll have questions. And often, they’ll have questions you can’t answer, and that can feel uncomfortable… mortifying even.</p>
<p>(You’re supposed to be the <em>expert</em>, right??)</p>
<p>According to Coach Kate, the above belief—that you’re supposed to be an authority with <em>all </em>the answers—is based on an erroneous assumption.</p>
<p>“When I show up to a coaching conversation, my role is not ‘the expert,’” she says.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, coaches have to show up to client interactions with a baseline of nutrition knowledge.</strong> (For example, if a client asks you about good sources of protein, you should be able to list some.)</p>
<p>But coaches <em>don’t</em> have to show up with a prepared lecture, or encyclopedic knowledge of nutrition minutia or biochemistry. (You don’t have to feel bad if you can’t recall the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 in flax oil, or all the steps in the Krebs cycle that produces ATP.)</p>
<p>Even when you know the answer, Kate suggests that <em>not </em>answering right away can actually be more productive.</p>
<p>“If a client asks you about seed oils, you can simply say, ‘That&#8217;s a great question. I can get you some information on that if you&#8217;d like, but I&#8217;m curious, why do you ask?’”</p>
<p>While the expert might respond with a summary of the latest research on seed oil processing and its health effects, <strong>the coach will strive to learn more about <em>why </em>the question is meaningful to the client.</strong></p>
<p>For example, after inquiring further, you may learn that your client heard about seed oils from their friend Susan, who changed the fat sources in her diet and lost ten pounds. And the client is curious to see if <em>they </em>might also lose ten pounds if they eliminate seed oils.</p>
<p>With this kind of response, you learn more about what the client is <em>really </em>after (a weight loss solution), which ultimately helps direct you to more effective strategies (which probably have nothing to do with seed oils).</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Takeaway nugget: </strong></p>
<p>Coaches should have a firm understanding of fitness and nutrition principles.</p>
<p>However, clients often don’t need more <em>information; </em>they need <em>coaching</em>.</p>
<p>When a client asks you a question, consider whether the answer will help them take action.</p>
<p>If it will, offer them what you know. (If you don’t know the answer, you can simply say, “I’m happy to find more information about that for you.”)</p>
<p>If it won’t, consider turning their question into a coaching opportunity. Ask, “Can you tell me why you’re curious about that?” Their answers will likely lead you to a more productive conversation.</p>
<h2>Coaching mistake #2: Assuming your clients are exactly like you</h2>
<p>Now, maybe it sounds obvious that clients aren’t just clones of us.</p>
<p>That said, especially when we feel all warm and vibe-y with our clients, it can be easy to forget in the moment.</p>
<p>For example, maybe you’re someone who…</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Tracks macros, and feels it’s relatively simple and effective. So you assume this approach will work on most clients (even though many will find it triggering and overwhelmingly complicated).</li>
<li>Coaches virtually, so your clients are all over the world. You might recommend meeting certain protein targets, without considering that in some communities, protein dense foods might either be hard to access, prohibitively expensive, or both.</li>
<li>Prioritizes fitness. And for the life of you, you can’t understand why your client would skip a lunch workout because she doesn’t want to mess up her hair and makeup in the middle of a work day.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a coach, you probably went into this line of work because you value nutrition, exercise, and overall health. And often, we assume our clients hold these same values. But the truth is, that’s not always the case.</p>
<p>Says Kate:</p>
<p>“There’s nothing inherently superior about valuing your health. If you do, yes, you’ll probably experience better health and live longer. But not everyone shares those values. That&#8217;s a tough one to swallow.”</p>
<p>Of course, without seeing your clients for the unique people they are—with their own individual preferences, values, and goals—you may find yourself suggesting behaviors that aren’t possible for them, or striving for goals that aren’t meaningful to them.</p>
<p>Over time, this becomes frustrating for your clients <em>and </em>you: They feel like you don’t “get” them, and you feel like a “bad” coach.</p>
<h3>Solution: Get a clear picture of the client’s baseline—and determine what actions <em>they’re </em>ready, willing, and able to take</h3>
<p>The opposite of assuming (often unconsciously) that clients are like you is, well, assuming nothing.</p>
<p>As best as you can, check your biases and assumptions at the door, and approach each client session with an open, curious mind.</p>
<p>Ask questions, such as:</p>
<p>“What inspired you—or pushed you—to come in today?”</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>“Why is that goal meaningful to you?”</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>“What skills do you have today that might help you achieve your goal? What skills do you feel you might be missing?”</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Withholding assumptions can be particularly difficult when clients share some obvious similarities with you. (Perhaps they’re also a single mom, or they’re also training for a triathlon, or they’re also a cancer survivor.)</p>
<p>But even when clients share similar experiences or goals, their biology, social context, personal history, and many other factors can make their “similar” experiences, in fact, totally different.</p>
<p>Coach Kate says in these cases, you can show that you relate to them, while also inviting them to describe their own experience. She suggests using the following question:</p>
<p>“I know what [<em>insert shared experience</em>] has been like for me, but what has [<em>insert shared experience</em>] been like for you?”</p>
<p>Once you have a clear picture of a client&#8217;s values, priorities, and reasons for change, you can assess which actions they’re ready, willing, and able to take. (Again, don’t make assumptions here. Just because you find meal prep quick and easy, doesn’t mean your client will.)</p>
<p>If you want to go through this exercise with your client on paper, use our <a href="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2019/09/Ready-Willing-and-Able-Worksheet-form-fillable-V4-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ready, Willing, and Able Worksheet</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Takeaway nugget: </strong></p>
<p>Remember that clients:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Aren’t always motivated by the same things as you (for example, they might care more about their next lab test results than how they look in a swimsuit)</li>
<li>Don’t always enjoy—or hate—the same things (just because you love long sessions of steady state cardio, doesn’t mean they will… or vice versa)</li>
<li>Don’t always share your values (as mentioned above, not all clients value health above all else; they may instead value pleasure, spontaneity, or something else)</li>
</ul>
<p>Get to know your unique client, their specific goals, and what actions <em>they </em>can realistically execute (and maybe even get excited about).</p>
<h2>Coaching mistake #3: Getting too attached to client results</h2>
<p>This is, actually, <em>very</em> natural.</p>
<p>“There’s a reason we go into coaching. It&#8217;s because we care and we want to help clients. We want to see them succeed,” says Coach Kate.</p>
<p>But caring can be a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>“With our clients, we carefully decide on the habits and behaviors that need to occur… And then they walk off and either do the thing or don&#8217;t do the thing. That’s brutal.”</p>
<p>No matter how sound and foolproof your advice is, how well-thought out your plan, how much <em>you </em>care, ultimately, you have no control over whether a client executes it, and gets results.</p>
<p>Naturally, as a coach, you might feel frustrated, even heartbroken when clients don’t do what they say they’ll do, or when they’re not seeing the outcomes they were hoping to see.</p>
<p>However, according to Kate, this <em>isn’t </em>something coaches should try to avoid completely. <strong>It’s part of the job, and it’s often a sign that your work has meaning to you. </strong>(It’s a good thing.)</p>
<p>“However, I think there’s a point there where we can start caring more than the client themselves,” she says.</p>
<p>And that’s precisely where to draw to the line.</p>
<p>At PN, we often say that “care units” are the currency of coaching.</p>
<p>Care units are how much time, energy, attention, authenticity, and true “heart” you can bring to helping, serving, and caring about your clients.</p>
<p>Your client also has a certain amount of care units.</p>
<p>How much time, energy, attention, authenticity, and “heart” can they bring to their own change and growth projects?</p>
<p>(Most of the time, not that much. Which is totally normal.)</p>
<p>Our advice: Care one care unit <em>less</em> than your client does.</p>
<p>How do you do that? One approach…</p>
<h3>Solution: Clearly separate client and coach responsibilities</h3>
<p>So, how do we maintain an appropriate level of emotional investment—but also help clients stay on track?</p>
<p>“This is where I really like to get really clear on what my role is as a coach,” Coach Kate says.</p>
<p>“Because if you are very, very clear on what your role is as a coach, then you can sort of go through the list, and check in with yourself: ‘Did I show up? Did I follow up? Did I coach this person to the best of my ability?’”</p>
<p>For example, as a coach, it’s reasonable to be responsible for:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Providing guidelines for how to reach out (to ask questions or book appointments) as well as setting expectations for your response times</li>
<li>Weekly check-ins with clients via email, text, or phone, to assess progress or troubleshoot obstacles</li>
<li>“Life-proofing” a program as much as possible, by proactively discussing obstacles that could arise in the future, and brainstorming realistic, flexible solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the client is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Whether or not they respond to your check-ins</li>
<li>Whether or not they actually DO the agreed upon fitness, nutrition, or lifestyle practices that are likely to get them to their goal</li>
<li>How much they reveal during coaching sessions (for example, whether or not they tell you if they’re struggling with stress eating, or some other issue that makes it hard to stick to the plan)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ideally, clearly delineating these responsibilities should happen early in the coaching relationship.</strong> Some coaches prefer to have an open discussion, while others have actual contracts that outline coach deliverables and client expectations.</p>
<p>This early communication can also be a way of vetting coach-client “fit.”</p>
<p>“When I&#8217;m having that initial conversation with a prospective client, I can ask, ‘What does accountability look like to you?’ If the client replies, ‘Well, I want you to text me every morning and night, and I want you to make sure I&#8217;ve done my workout, and also ship groceries to my house,’ then I will be the one to say, ‘I don&#8217;t think this is a good fit.’”</p>
<p>Coach Kate says this kind of early clarity can also prevent coach-client friction in the future.</p>
<p>Clear boundaries and expectations at the outset means clients are less likely to be disappointed if they assumed their coach was going to “take on” more, and coaches are less likely to burn out from shouldering more than they should.</p>
<p>It even protects the coach-client relationship in extreme (though not uncommon) situations such as when a client “ghosts” before a paid contract is over.</p>
<p>“When somebody doesn&#8217;t reply to me, I don&#8217;t take it personally. It&#8217;s not their job to reply, but it <em>is</em> my job to check in,” Coach Kate says.</p>
<p>“If I don&#8217;t hear back, I just check in on Monday, and then again on Monday. And again, and again, and again—trying all the contact methods they’ve provided me—until their coaching contract is over. If we get to that point, they’ll get an email from me saying, ‘Hey, I hope everything&#8217;s okay. My door is always open. I hope you&#8217;re doing well.’”</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Takeaway nugget: </strong></p>
<p>Make a list—either for your own reference, or to include in a contract that new clients have to sign—of the accountabilities you have as a coach.</p>
<p>(Hint: These are usually <em>specific actions</em>, like “Text, email, or phone once a week to check in” or “Host monthly virtual lectures on various nutrition topics for group clients.”)</p>
<p>Make sure to have a conversation about expectations and responsibilities with all clients, ideally before beginning to work together, or at least in the first session.</p>
<h2>Bonus mistake: Forgetting to give yourself a pat on the back</h2>
<p>It’s maybe not the most “coach-y” way to write an article: Point out a list of your mistakes, then hand you solutions to deal with them.</p>
<p>But if you’ve made the above “mistakes,” we want you to hear it from us:</p>
<p><strong>We’re proud of you.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve gotten sidetracked by the above, it’s likely because you <em>really</em> care. And that’s never going to be a mistake; it’s a strength.</p>
<p>That said, although these “mistakes” are completely normal, and most coaches make them, they <em>can </em>limit your potential as a coach, and as a business.</p>
<p>And we want to see you succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“I just bought a new BPA-free tupperware set.”</h2>
<p>This comment, coming from my friend Anna, caught me off guard.</p>
<p>Anna’s a highly competent law professional. She’s a critical thinker and she fights in the heavyweight division when it comes to cutting through BS.</p>
<p>But the Anna I knew was falling into some painful traps that seemed to be bypassing her inner hawk-like skeptic.</p>
<p>She’s wanted to lose around 15lbs for some time now and came to me to share how <em>stuck</em> she was feeling in this goal.</p>
<p>She brought up an avenue she was exploring: the new BPA-free tupperware set.</p>
<p>“Interesting. What inspired you to focus on that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve been reading about how microplastics in food containers can mess up our hormones and cause weight gain,” she said.</p>
<p>I squinted.</p>
<p>To backtrack, this is right after she told me how she’d been struggling to be consistent at the gym, had been relying on takeout too often, and had been sacrificing boring old sleep for adrenaline-inducing doom scrolling.</p>
<p>So I asked:</p>
<p>“What about trying to get more consistent with your workouts, or prepping more homemade meals during the week?”</p>
<p>And Anna said:</p>
<p><strong>“Yeah, but I’ve tried that a thousand times. If it were that simple, it would have worked already.”</strong></p>
<h3>We&#8217;ve all done this before.</h3>
<p>Ignored or delayed those hard-but-worthwhile habit changes in favor of some ultra-specific, niche magic bullet that’s supposed to “change everything.”</p>
<p>Spent hours of research on the ultimate, most optimal workout instead of devoting those hours to just doing the basic workout you already know how to do.</p>
<p>Waited to feel more inspired, motivated, or just <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/pause-button-mentality-infographic">less busy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we do this?</strong></p>
<p>Buying new gear or a popular supplement <em>feels </em>like making progress.</p>
<p>Consuming YouTube videos or articles about stuff you can change <em>feels </em>like you’re doing something.</p>
<p>And waiting until the &#8220;right time&#8221; <em>feels</em>, well, right.</p>
<p><strong>Except, nothing actually changes until we take real, consistent action.</strong></p>
<p>We’re clever, us humans. And we’ve come up with lots of sneaky ways to avoid the basic, unsexy, difficult <em>actions </em>we need to take that actually drive change.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explore how to take an honest and compassionate look at why you might be distracting yourself from taking impactful action.</p>
<p>You’ll learn:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>What the <strong>most impactful health habits</strong> actually are</li>
<li><strong>Three common barriers</strong> to making sustainable progress</li>
<li>A <strong>4-step process you can apply to start taking positive, productive action</strong></li>
<li>How to <strong>keep yourself consistent</strong>—and achieve your goals</li>
</ul>
<h2>The stuff you know you should do (but probably aren’t doing consistently)</h2>
<p>We all know what those basic, fundamental health habits are:</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Exercising, ideally 30 minutes a day</strong>, putting in moderate-to-vigorous amounts of effort, with a mix of aerobic and resistance training.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Eating mostly nutritious, minimally-processed foods.</strong> If 80 percent of your diet comes from whole or minimally-processed foods, you’re doing an excellent job. (Translation: “Perfection” isn’t required; pizza can be part of a healthy diet.)</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Eating enough protein to support muscle mass, appetite regulation, and body recomposition goals, if you have them.</strong> Aim for about 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (for most people, this adds up to about 4-6 palm-sized portions of lean protein per day).</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Prioritizing getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep. </strong>You can’t always control how well you sleep, but having some wind-down time before bed can help, as can waking up at the same time every day.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Avoiding or at least reducing excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs, including cigarettes. </strong>No fun, we know. But it’s for a good cause.</p>
<p>Easily, we could add stuff like prioritizing positive, nurturing social relationships, managing stress, and probably others, but just the above list is uncommonly met.</p>
<p>In fact, only <em>six percent</em> of Americans perform all five of the following basic health behaviors:<sup>1</sup></p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Meet physical activity recommendations</li>
<li>Don’t smoke</li>
<li>Consume alcohol in moderation (or not at all)</li>
<li>Sleep at least seven hours</li>
<li>Maintain a “normal” BMI</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you’re doing the math, that means close to <em>94 percent</em> of Americans <em>aren’t </em>doing the basics.</strong></p>
<p>Yet, these foundational behaviors also help us achieve a long list of common goals, whether that’s reaching a healthy weight, improving athletic ability, or just living a longer, healthier life.</p>
<p>So why do we struggle so much to <em>do </em>them?</p>
<p>Here are three common barriers we see among clients (and coaches!), plus potential solutions to overcome them.</p>
<div class="callout_box"></p>
<h2>By the way, ambivalence is normal.</h2>
<p>That push-and-pull feeling you have when you think about making a change?</p>
<p>It has a name, and it’s called <strong>ambivalence. </strong></p>
<p>Ambivalence describes the mix of feelings you have when you contemplate, say, waking up earlier so your mornings are less stressful, or cutting down on TV time.</p>
<p>We naturally and normally feel ambivalence about change—“I want this, and at the same time, that.”</p>
<p>(For example, wanting to eat healthier, <em>and also</em> wanting to have your favorite treats whenever you want without constraint.)</p>
<p>We also naturally and normally feel <strong>resistance</strong> towards change—“I want this, and at the same time, not.”</p>
<p>(For example, wanting to stop using your phone as a mindless distraction, <em>but not</em> wanting to deal with the anxiety you get whenever you’re left with your own thoughts.)</p>
<p>These contradictory emotions can seem frustrating, puzzling, or “illogical.” Yet, <strong>ambivalence and resistance are fundamental parts of the change process</strong>.</p>
<p>The higher the stakes of change, the more likely we are to feel a mix of strong and unexpected emotions, pushback, rebellion, angst, and other types of resistance and ambivalence.</p>
<p>Rather than signaling that the change is a wrong move, strong ambivalence and resistance tend to signal that <strong>this change matters to us.</strong></p>
<p>In a sense, it’s good news.</p>
<p><strong>It tells us we care.</strong></p>
<p></div>
<h2>Basics Barrier #1: You have ambition overload.</h2>
<p>Maybe you’ve decided you want to be healthier. So you declare that, starting Monday, you’re going to exercise for an hour everyday <em>and </em>“eat clean” at every meal <em>and </em>sleep eight hours every night.</p>
<p>(Currently, you don’t have a regular exercise habit, don’t particularly like vegetables, and regularly stay up past midnight.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s be honest: <strong>You’re asking yourself to change a lot of stuff at once.</strong></p>
<p>And the last time you created an elaborate plan for overhauling your life…</p>
<p>… Did it work?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>(And that’s okay.)</p>
<p><strong>When we feel frustrated or stuck in our current situation, making a plan filled with idealistic dreams can provide us temporary relief. </strong></p>
<p>And our brain has several (normal) cognitive biases that prevent us from judging the future accurately.</p>
<p>We often think we’ll have more time, energy, attention, and motivation in the future than we really do.<sup>2 3 4 5</sup></p>
<p>There’s a powerful, instantaneous comfort that comes with overloading our future self. (Because after all, we won’t start the plan until Monday.)</p>
<p>The problem with this is:</p>
<p><strong>Big, complex plans often don’t fit into our already busy, complex lives.</strong></p>
<p>We under-estimate how many smaller tasks are hidden in the bigger plans.</p>
<p>When we (almost inevitably) are unable to execute these ambitious goals, we blame ourselves, our personality traits, our “willpower” or “discipline,” and build a pitiable story about how we “struggle with consistency.” Or how living this way is “impossible”.</p>
<p>Then, sadly, we fulfill that prophecy.</p>
<h2>Basics Barrier #2: You think only hardcore, “industry-secret,” or “cutting-edge” stuff works.</h2>
<p>This barrier comes from the following common belief:</p>
<p><strong>“If getting healthy just took eating, sleeping, and exercising moderately well, then everyone would be healthy.”</strong></p>
<p>Because everyone <em>knows</em> they should eat their vegetables, get seven to eight hours of sleep per night, and stay active, right?</p>
<p>(We’d agree.)</p>
<p>But let’s go back to the previously mentioned statistic:</p>
<p><strong>Only 6 percent of Americans are consistently performing the most basic health and fitness behaviors. </strong></p>
<p>If we add on slightly more advanced—but still very basic—behaviors like eating five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, optimizing protein intake, and effectively managing stress, that number would shrink <em>significantly.</em></p>
<p>So, the first thing is to <em>believe</em> that these simple behaviors work. Because they do. It’s just that most people (probably close to 99 percent of us) are not doing them all <em>simultaneously</em> and <em>consistently</em>.</p>
<p>The second thing is to accept that these simple behaviors are a little bit boring. Because they are. Part of the reason we’re attracted to new diets or “magical” supplements is because we just want something more <em>interesting </em>to try.</p>
<p>That’s especially true if we’ve already sort of tried the “eat more vegetables” thing and it didn’t “work” for us in the way we expected.</p>
<p><strong>With something new and cutting-edge, there’s also the possibility of a new outcome, a new us. </strong></p>
<p>And of course, that’s incredibly appealing.</p>
<p>Thing is, most hardcore, “industry secret,” or “cutting edge” tools and strategies are, respectively: unsustainable, inaccessible, or ineffective (or unproven).</p>
<p>They’ll take your effort, your time, and often your money, but without giving you a good return on your investment—all the while distracting you from the stuff that actually works.</p>
<h2>Basics Barrier #3: You think your efforts (and your results) have to be perfect.</h2>
<p>Another lie in the health and fitness industry is that you have to be “perfect” to maintain great health. You know, eat only organic salads and chia seeds, be able to run a marathon, and wake up at 5 am every day to meditate and write in your gratitude journal.</p>
<p><strong>The truth is, perfection definitely isn’t required.</strong></p>
<p>Depending on how you look at this, this could be a relief to hear, or a disappointment.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it’s nice to know that you don’t have to have it “all together” to be healthy—even above-average healthy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>many of us pursue better health with the belief that our optimal or even “perfect” self will one day, with the right plan or routine, be attainable.</strong></p>
<p>But “perfect” health is an illusion.</p>
<p>Humans, even exceptionally healthy ones, get sick, get weird rashes, have digestive problems, need reading glasses, get into slumps, or just otherwise have a series of bad days.</p>
<p>None of us are “safe” from those life events, and accepting that can feel a little… vulnerable.</p>
<p>It’s much more comfortable to believe that if you just take this powdered algae supplement, or follow this specific morning routine, you’ll be immune to any kind of painful human experience.</p>
<p><strong>The irony is, to achieve your <em>realistic </em>“best self,” you probably have to accommodate your “worst self” too.</strong> You know, the one who’d rather watch another episode of <em>Love is Blind </em>than work out, or eat a party-size bag of Doritos and call it dinner.</p>
<p>Because life happens.</p>
<p>Work gets busy.</p>
<p>Or your kid goes through a “phase.”</p>
<p>Or it’s pie season.</p>
<p>Any number of obstacles, distractions, and competing demands make it impossible for perfection to be maintained with any kind of consistency.</p>
<p>Which is why we need to let go of the illusion that a “perfect” self exists—the one who always has the energy, will, and option to make the ideal choice—and support what our <em>real </em>self wants and needs.</p>
<p>We’ve got four steps below to help you.</p>
<h2>4 steps to start taking effective (and realistic) action</h2>
<p>Now that we know what’s potentially getting in the way of taking productive action, here are four steps to get unstuck.</p>
<h3>Step #1: Explore the why before the how.</h3>
<p>Before you (or a client) start undertaking something you want to change, it’s helpful to understand your deeper motivations first.</p>
<p>Do a little investigating by asking questions like:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>What about this change is important to you?</li>
<li>How serious or pressing is this for you?</li>
<li>Why not continue doing what you’re already doing?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also go through one of our favorite motivation-mining exercises, <a href="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2019/08/worksheet-the-5-whys.pdf"><strong>The 5 Whys</strong></a>.</p>
<p>When you know <em>why </em>you want to change something, and you’re clear on the consequences of <em>not </em>taking action, you’ll be more likely to feel that deeper, more sustaining push to keep going, even when things get tough.</p>
<h3>Step #2: Prioritize the most effective actions.</h3>
<p>We can do all the things!! Really!! We just can’t do all the things… all at once.</p>
<p>Effective change means being able to realistically:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Identify all the tasks, trade-offs, and commitments involved</li>
<li>Prioritize what matters for the results you want</li>
<li>Figure out what to do first</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the essentials in relation to your goal? Regardless of all goals, they likely include a movement practice, a nutrition practice, and/or a recovery practice.</p>
<p>If you want some guidance on how to select the most effective action for your goal, check out our <strong><a href="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2020/11/Level-1-Skills-Practices-Daily-Actions-Cheat-Sheet_FINAL-1.pdf">Skills, Practices, and Daily Actions Cheat Sheet.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Here’s how to use it:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Start with the <strong>domain</strong> you’re most interested in improving (such as “Nutrition” or “Stress”).</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Then, get specific about what <strong>skill</strong> within that domain you’d like to improve (for example, “Eat well intuitively”), plus the <strong>practice</strong> that most appeals to you within that skill (say, “Eat to satisfied”).</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Lastly, choose a <strong>daily action</strong> from the list of examples under your chosen practice. (For example, “Record hunger and fullness levels at the start and end of meals.”)</p>
<p>Once you choose your action, make it work for you by following step 3, below.</p>
<h3>Step #3: Make sure you can take action, even on your worst day.</h3>
<p>“I like to challenge a client to set a pathetic goal. If it’s so pathetic, then obviously you can do it, right?” says Kate Solovieva, PN Super Coach and Director of Community Engagement.</p>
<p>Sound inspiring?</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>But if you’ve been struggling with consistency, it’s exactly where to start.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>What can I do on my absolutely worst day where everything goes wrong? How much time, effort, or enthusiasm will I realistically have?</li>
</ul>
<p>Five minutes of walking? 10 push-ups? One extra portion of veggies? Three conscious deep breaths before every meal? Nothing is too small; it just has to be <em>something.</em></p>
<p><strong>Now you’ve got your floor.</strong></p>
<p>Then ask yourself:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>What can I do on my <em>best </em>day, when I feel on top of the world and circumstances are on my side? How much time, effort, or enthusiasm will I realistically have?</li>
</ul>
<p>One-hour of all-out effort at the gym? Two hours of meal prep that will feed you and your family for the next three days? A 45-minute guided meditation?</p>
<p><strong>This is your ceiling.</strong></p>
<p>Now that you’ve identified your “floor” and your “ceiling,” you’ve defined a flexible range of actions that can adapt to your fluctuating, unpredictable, real life.</p>
<p>But <em>applying</em> this range requires a paradigm shift:</p>
<p><strong>Your health habits aren’t an “on” or “off” switch; they’re on a dial.</strong></p>
<p>When life is sweet and smooth, you can turn your exercise, nutrition, and sleep dials way up—if you want. Bust through your PRs at the gym, eat all the arugula, meditate like a monk.</p>
<p>But if life gets nuts, you don’t have to switch off completely.</p>
<p>Just turn the dial down a little.</p>
<p>The below is a visual representation of how this might work for exercise, but you can apply this same thinking to your nutrition, sleep, stress management, or whatever you’re working on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-144748" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3.png" alt="1-10 movement dial filled" width="2500" height="1700" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3.png 2500w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3-300x204.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3-1024x696.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3-768x522.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3-1536x1044.png 1536w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3-2048x1393.png 2048w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3-94x64.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/05/dial-movement3-295x201.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></p>
<p>The important part: Even if you do your “floor” or “dial level 1” action—even if it’s for days on end—it still “counts.”</p>
<p>You still get the gold star.</p>
<p><strong>Doing the bare minimum <em>isn’t </em>failing. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It’s succeeding, in the context of a real, messy, beautiful life. </strong></p>
<h3>Step #4: Create an ecosystem that supports you.</h3>
<p>Health and fitness professionals often forget how different their lives are from their clients.</p>
<p>For example, many coaches work at gyms, enjoy being physically active, and hang out with other active people. Exercising regularly is almost easier <em>to do</em> than <em>not do</em>, because, as Coach Kate says, “they’ve built a life that makes that habit seamless.”</p>
<p>So if you want to make your health goals more likely, Coach Kate offers this advice:</p>
<p>“Build an ecosystem that makes failing nearly impossible.”</p>
<p><strong>When they want to make a change, many people assume that good intentions and willpower will be enough to carry them through.</strong> (And when they fail, naturally, they blame themselves for being “bad” or “weak.”)</p>
<p><strong>We often forget about the context and environment that <em>shapes </em>our behaviors</strong>—making certain actions more likely or less likely to occur.</p>
<p>A recent review from <em>Nature Reviews Psychology </em>ranked different behavior change strategies and found that <em>access </em>was the number one influencer of people’s behaviors. (People who lived in neighborhoods with affordable grocers close by ate better, just like people who had to drive a long distance to the closest gym were less likely to exercise.<sup>6</sup>)</p>
<p>Not everyone can change neighborhoods, but most people have <em>some </em>degree of control over their more immediate environments, and can leverage this power to shape desired behaviors.</p>
<p>One example is the “<strong>kitchen makeover</strong>,” where you make sure foods you <em>want </em>to eat are washed, prepped, and at the front of the fridge, ready to eat on a whim. Meanwhile, foods that <em>don’t</em> support your goals get tossed, or relegated to the highest cupboard. (When you need a stepladder from the basement to reach the cookies, you might find you eat them less.)</p>
<p>(If you want to try it out, check out our <a href="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2019/09/Kitchen-Set-up-Assessment-form-fillable-V4-2019.pdf">Kitchen Set-up Assessment </a>worksheet.)</p>
<p>Think about the goal you want to achieve, and the behaviors that support it. Then, evaluate how you might make small changes to your environment by:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li><strong>Using a trigger</strong>: Sometimes called a “cue” or a “prompt,” a trigger is simply a reminder to do a desired action. For example, you might block the door of your home office with a kettlebell, reminding you that, every time you leave or enter the office, you have to do ten kettlebell swings. If you’re trying to cut down on mindless phone time, you can install an app that reminds you to shut things down after 20 minutes on social media.</li>
<li><strong>Decreasing “friction”</strong>: Supermarkets put candy next to the checkout, making it easy to slip that chocolate bar into your cart while you’re standing in line, likely bored and hungry. You can be equally sneaky about encouraging positive behaviors too, such as putting fruit on your counter, ready for a quick snack, or packing your gym bag the night before, so it’s ready to grab on your way out the door before you change your mind.</li>
<li><strong>Constraining available options:</strong> Whether it’s deleting time-sucking apps off your phone, removing foods you know you lose control around from your kitchen, or heck, creating a capsule wardrobe so you waste less time in the morning getting dressed, constraint can actually<em> free up </em>a lot of time, brain power, and energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Invest your energy building the ecosystem that nudges you to make desired actions the <em>obvious</em> choice. This requires a little more work on the front end, but the payoff will be greater for less overall work.</p>
<h2>Embrace C+ effort.</h2>
<p>If you’re a perfectionist, or a former straight-A student, that line hurt to read.</p>
<p>(Don’t worry. This C+ won’t result in your parents telling you that they’re disappointed.)</p>
<p>But what all of the above barriers and solutions have in common, is that they recognize and work with our inherent imperfection.</p>
<p>None of us is perfect, and expecting as much often results in failure (or at best, short bursts of success, followed by a crash).</p>
<p>Adopt an attitude of compassion and acceptance towards your human self—who’s most likely trying their hardest—and work <em>with </em>your vulnerabilities, instead of constantly expecting yourself to grit your teeth against them.</p>
<p>There will be times you’re getting “A’s” in fitness. That’s awesome. And you also don’t need to <em>aim</em> for C+. Just don’t think of yourself as a failure when you have to dial it down.</p>
<p>Living a healthy, meaningful life means constantly striving to do our best—while also allowing for flexibility, mistakes, and bad days (or seasons).</p>
<p>You’ll be surprised at how much better “good enough” is than nothing. Especially in the long run.</p>

<hr class="top" />
<h2>At some point in my mid-40s, the scale started climbing.</h2>
<p>A pound or two turned into five, then 10, then 20.</p>
<p>It seemed as if I was doing all the right things: Eating less, moving more, rinse, repeat. Yet, the harder I worked, the less the scale seemed to respond.</p>
<p><strong>Had perimenopause destroyed my metabolism? </strong></p>
<p>It sure felt like it.</p>
<p>However, after asking my doctor to run a series of tests, I learned that my metabolism was, in fact, fine. Instead, like the vast majority of midlife women, the true causes of my weight gain stemmed from several subtle issues that I would have sworn, at the time, didn’t apply to me.</p>
<p>If, like me, you or your client are currently stuck in what feels like an eat less, gain more cycle, this article is here to help.</p>
<p>In this story, you’ll discover:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Several reasons women gain weight at midlife that have <strong>nothing to do with a “slower metabolism”</strong></li>
<li>Why <strong>intense exercise and strict diets can backfire</strong> after menopause</li>
<li>11 crafty ways to <strong>get a handle on midlife weight gain</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>First, what is menopause?</h2>
<p>Many women refer to midlife hot flashes and inconsistent menstruation as “being in menopause” or “menopausal.”</p>
<p>However, menopause isn’t a <em>phase</em> as much as a transitional <em>moment</em> that separates menstruation from non-menstruation.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gone 12 consecutive months without a period, you’ve reached menopause. For most people, that moment arrives somewhere between ages 46 and 56.</p>
<p><strong>The hot-and-dewy months and years leading up to that 12th missed period are technically known as “perimenopause.” </strong></p>
<h3>Perimenopause means “around menopause.”</h3>
<p>Some people refer to this time as <strong>the menopause transition</strong>. This is when estrogen levels fluctuate. Menstrual cycles lengthen and shorten and, at times, disappear, only to return a few months later. For many people, this marks the beginning of symptoms like hot flashes, sleep issues, vaginal dryness, mood changes, and, yes, creeping weight gain.</p>
<p>(For a thorough overview of the many changes that can happen during this time, read: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/feel-your-best-during-menopause?fbclid=IwY2xjawEZyThleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbXu5YArAxzSH62DtYW5uPdCeeveST-b4paD8roiRPlkAbo843rPGwDZgw_aem_0hlJeK66yNzXUyncoqh8NA">‘What’s happening to my body!?’ 6 lifestyle strategies to try after menopause</a>)</p>
<h2>How much weight do women gain during menopause?</h2>
<p>Many women think of menopause and weight gain the same way many young parents think of two-year-olds and tantrums: Inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>However, not all women gain weight during the menopause transition</strong>, explains Helen Kollias, PhD, who is an expert on physiology and molecular biology, and a science advisor at Precision Nutrition and Girls Gone Strong.</p>
<p>On average, in the West, women gain four to six pounds during the three-and-a-half years of perimenopause, or about one to two pounds a year.<sup>1 2</sup></p>
<p>That’s double the rate of weight gain in pre-menopausal women, though it’s roughly the same amount men gain at midlife, notes Dr. Kollias.</p>
<p>In other words, the menopause transition may not be solely to blame for those extra pounds on the scale. Aging may play a significant role, as we explore below.</p>
<h2>The real reasons the scale climbs</h2>
<p>Several factors conspire to add pounds to your frame during the menopause transition.</p>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You’re not sleeping as well.</h3>
<p>Maybe this sounds familiar: You wake repeatedly with sweat pooling under your breasts and sheets that are uncomfortably damp (or soaked).</p>
<p><strong>Even if you don’t have night sweats, plenty of other issues might keep you awake.</strong></p>
<p>First, there’s worry—over aging parents, teenagers with car keys, money needed to replace that leaking roof, some strange bodily sensation you’re worried might be cancer, the colonoscopy or mammogram you don’t want to schedule but also don’t <em>not </em>want to schedule, the sex you’re not having, and so many others.</p>
<p>Plus, if you’re like me and you have osteoarthritis in multiple joints, your body hurts. Or your skin might itch. Or your legs are restless. Or you’re bloated.<sup>3 4 5 6</sup></p>
<p>My point: Problems that make sleep uncomfortable can multiply with age.</p>
<p>Because of this, I&#8217;ll sometimes wake four or more times a night, as the red sections of this readout from my smartwatch show.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145747" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/sleep-chart.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of a sleep tracking app's data for one night of sleep.

<p>These bad nights often set up a vicious cycle:</p>
<p>The following day, I feel as if I’m two inhales away from death. So, I keep myself going with caffeine, which makes the next night just as bad or worse.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep indirectly adds pounds to your frame in several ways:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>When you’re sleep-deprived, it’s harder to cope with negative emotions, which may mean you turn to food for solace.</li>
<li>In addition, your decision-making gets compromised, so it’s harder to choose an apple when a chocolate chip cookie is also available.</li>
<li>Plus, sleep deprivation intensify both appetite and cravings (which we’ll discuss more in the next section)</li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You’re hungry, and not for celery.</h3>
<p>True story: When I was in my early 30s, someone once told me about her intense cravings, and I thought, “Cravings? What are those exactly?”</p>
<p>(Don’t hate me.)</p>
<p>Those days now feel foreign to me. Post-menopause, I spend most of my morning wondering how soon I can eat lunch, what I might have for lunch, whether it&#8217;s okay to have a snack now, and, if so, what it should be.</p>
<p>After lunch, I go on to spend the afternoon thinking about dinner.</p>
<p>It’s as if my appetite never flips off.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I thought something was wrong with my brain or metabolism.</p>
<p>It didn’t occur to me that the increased hunger, appetite, and cravings likely stemmed from my repeated awakenings each night.</p>
<p>Until I checked out the research.</p>
<p>In one study, people who were sleep-deprived reported higher levels of hunger and a stronger desire to eat. When provided access to snacks, they consumed twice as much fat compared to days when they weren’t sleep-deprived.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>In another study, when healthy, young study participants slept four hours a night, they consumed 350 more calories the following day.<sup>8</sup></p>
<div class="callout_box"></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annoying cycle of weight and food preoccupation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hormonal transitions (puberty, pregnancy, menopause) often cause changes to women’s body shape and size.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes that’s welcome (“Ooh, a butt!”) and sometimes it’s not (“Darn, a butt!”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some women—like me—don’t worry too much about their weight or body shape. Then, we gain unexpected (and unwanted) pounds, and with that, a new (also unwanted) preoccupation with the scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many women also find that as they try to get a handle on the scale, their preoccupation with food may (frustratingly and paradoxically!) shoot upwards—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if they turn to restrictive diets or food rules for a solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, </span><b>this preoccupation with food can occur whether or not someone is </b><b><i>actually </i></b><b>reducing their calorie intake.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In other words, this phenomenon can happen when someone just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thinks </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">about reducing their food intake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phenomenon has a name: It’s called </span><b>cognitive dietary restraint (CDR)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it can create a frustrating cycle of body image dissatisfaction, food preoccupation, and stress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one study, people who used a low-carb, intermittent fasting protocol to lose weight reported more frequent episodes of binge eating and more intense food cravings.<sup>9</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another study, postmenopausal women who scored high in CDR excreted more of the stress hormone cortisol than women who scored lower in this measure.<sup>10</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Higher levels of CDR in pre- and postmenopausal women were even associated with shorter telomeres, a sign of accelerated aging.<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this to say, </span><b>leaning too hard into self-criticism and extreme dieting can backfire.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Which is why the strategies we suggest later in this article focus more on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">adding </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more nutritious, appetite-regulating foods, and prioritizing things like mindfulness and movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these approaches, you’ll be less likely to feel deprived, and more likely to feel satisfied—and hopefully, empowered.</span></p>
<p></div>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You’re moving less.</h3>
<p>As humans age, we develop chronic low-grade inflammation and weakened immune function. When combined with the crummy sleep we mentioned earlier, along with other biological changes, this can interfere with the body’s ability to recover from intense exercise.</p>
<p>The result: If you do too many vigorous workouts too close together, you’ll start to feel run down, sore, and unmotivated.<sup>12 13 14</sup></p>
<p>Other issues that crop up around midlife can also interfere with movement, like chronic injuries or joint pain.</p>
<p>(A personal example: Due to osteoarthritis in my feet and spine, I switched from running to walking. This is easier on my body, but isn’t as efficient at burning calories.)</p>
<p>Finally, due to those pesky time-sucks known as full-time jobs and caregiving responsibilities, you might not be as active in your 40s and 50s as you were during your 20s. Plus, over the past few decades, multiple inventions (hello, binge-watching) have conspired to keep people on the couch and off our feet.</p>
<h2>So, can you blame your hormones for <em>anything</em>?</h2>
<p>Other than messing with your sleep which, in turn, messes with your appetite and energy levels, <strong>fluctuating estrogen and progesterone likely aren’t behind your extra pounds—at least, not directly.</strong></p>
<p>If they were, menopause hormone therapy would help people stop or reverse weight gain. (It doesn’t.<sup>15)</sup></p>
<p>However,<strong> shifting hormonal levels are responsible for <em>where</em> those extra pounds appear on your body.</strong> As estrogen levels drop, body fat tends to migrate away from the thighs and hips and toward the abdomen, even if you don’t gain weight</p>
<h2>Old tactics may stop working after menopause</h2>
<p>The “Rocky” weight loss method was my go-to when I was younger.</p>
<p>Whenever I wanted to drop a few pounds, I imagined I was a character in one of those “couch potato gets super fit” movies.</p>
<p>In addition to walking and running, I embraced the sweat-til-you-vomit workout du jour. (Remember Tae Bo?) I also cut out foods, food groups, or entire macronutrients. A couple of times a week, I skipped lunch or dinner.</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>Until, of course, it didn’t.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I push too hard in the gym, I either get injured or feel so unbelievably tired that I must take four days off from all forms of movement. If I try to do anything extreme with my diet, I eventually eat every crunchy or sweet thing I can find, including stale crackers.</p>
<p>For these reasons, after midlife and beyond, the countermeasures for weight gain<em> aren’t </em>strict diets (looking at you, <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/intermittent-fasting-women">intermittent fasting</a>) or barfy workouts.</p>
<p>Instead, to limit weight gain after menopause, you need to get wise about finding ways to tip calorie balance in your favor <em>without</em> triggering overpowering hunger, cravings, and fatigue.</p>
<p>Regardless of age or stage, <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/principles-of-nutrition">fundamental nutrition and fitness strategies</a> still apply—and work.</p>
<p>What changes after menopause is <em>how </em>you tackle these fundamentals.</p>
<h2>Experiment your way to better results</h2>
<p>The best menopause plan will look different for each person.</p>
<p>That’s why experiments are so important.</p>
<p>Precision Nutrition coaches often use experiments to help clients discover essential clues about what they need (and <em>don’t</em> need) to reach their goals. Based on the results you get from each experiment, you can make tiny tweaks, test them, and decide whether they work for you—until you find something that <em>does </em>work for you.</p>
<p><!-- You have some errors, warnings, or alerts. If you are using reckless mode, turn it off to see inline alerts. * ERRORs: 3 * WARNINGs: 0 * ALERTS: 3 --></p>
<h3>How to run an experiment</h3>
<p>Health experiments are no different from the scientific method you learned about in middle school.</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li><strong>Choose a question to answer</strong>, such as, “Would I feel less munchy at night if I ate a protein-rich snack every afternoon?”</li>
<li><strong>Run an experiment to test your question.</strong> In the above example, you’d track your hunger and cravings before adding the snack—to get a baseline—and then continue to track them for a couple weeks after adding the snack.</li>
<li><strong>Assess what you learned.</strong> Did your ratings of hunger and cravings drop? Remain the same? Go up? What about your actual nighttime food consumption? This information can help you determine your next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are 11 experiments worth trying during and after menopause. We’ve separated them into three categories: <a href="#heading=h.i61ktq97tedq">sleep</a>, <a href="#heading=h.fqded7dfda4p">hunger</a>, and <a href="#heading=h.xnr84qnx4f0r">energy</a>.</p>
<p>(And if those 11 options aren’t enough, we’ve got more ideas here: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/3-diet-experiments-to-change-eating-habits">Three diet experiments that can change your eating habits</a>)</p>
<h2>Experiments for improved sleep</h2>
<p>Below, you’ll find a mere smidge of the many sleep tweaks you can try and test. For more ideas on potential sleep experiments, check out our <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/how-to-sleep-better">14-day-sleep plan</a> and story about <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/how-to-get-better-sleep">cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia</a>.</p>
<h3>Experiment #1: Reset your body’s circadian clock</h3>
<p>As you age, your body starts to behave like an old clock that continually runs slow.</p>
<p>Even if you used to be a morning person, you might wake groggy, as if your body doesn’t know it’s morning. Or, your body might tell you “time for bed” at weird times, like the middle of the afternoon. Then, after spending several hours fighting the urge to nod off during work meetings, you find that, when it actually is bedtime, you’re staring at the ceiling in the dark.</p>
<p>This is why it’s helpful to experiment with <strong>zeitgebers</strong>, which are environmental and behavioral time cues that help to set your body’s internal circadian clock.</p>
<p>These experiments might include the following:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Get up at the same time every day, regardless of how you slept the night before.</li>
<li>Spend 10-20 minutes in the sunlight as soon as possible after you wake.</li>
<li>Take a cold shower at the same time each morning or a hot shower or bath at the same time each evening.</li>
<li>Get outside frequently during the day, especially whenever you feel sleepy.</li>
<li>Exercise at the same time daily. Try first thing in the morning or 4 to 6 hours before bed. Bonus points if you do it outdoors.</li>
<li>Eat meals, especially breakfast, at the same time every day.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Experiment #2: Remove “I’m uncomfortable” from your sleep vocabulary</h3>
<p>How you run this experiment will depend on what’s causing discomfort. We’ve listed a few possibilities below.</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li><strong>If you tend to wake feeling uncomfortably hot</strong>: Experiment with cooling technology. This might range from the very affordable, such as turning the thermostat a degree or two cooler or using a fan, to the more expensive, such as cooling electric mattress pads.</li>
<li><strong>If you wake feeling bloated</strong>: If you’re constipated, try some prunes, a small daily serving of beans, a little psyllium fiber, or just extra water to get things moving. Or, you might try consuming a smaller meal or avoiding fatty foods in the evening.</li>
<li><strong>If an uncomfortable “I need to move” sensation creeps into your legs at night</strong>: Talk to your doctor about restless legs syndrome, a condition that tends to worsen with age and/or iron deficiency. A physician may also give you ideas to cope if itchy skin or joint pain is keeping you up.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Experiment #3: Time caffeine strategically</h3>
<p>We know we’re almost picking a fight with this suggestion. However, it’s worth investigating, especially if you consume caffeine in the afternoon or evening.</p>
<p>If you’re like most people, it will take your body about five hours to clear half the caffeine from your system. That means about half of your 4 p.m. latte is still energizing your system at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: Some people metabolize caffeine much more slowly than others, taking roughly twice as long to clear it from their bloodstream.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, even if you had no issues with caffeine when you were younger, you might have issues now, as caffeine clearance tends to slow over time.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>To see if caffeine is a problem, you’ve got a couple of options.</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Try slowly shifting your consumption earlier by 30 to 60 minutes. (If you usually have your last coffee at 4 p.m., cut yourself off at 3 p.m., then 2 p.m., then 1 p.m., then noon.)</li>
<li>Switch to a lower caffeine source. (Try a bean blend that’s half decaffeinated. Or, you could switch to a lower-caffeine beverage such as green tea or maté.)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Yet more solutions to common problems: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/sleep-problems">The five top reasons you can’t sleep</a>)</p>
<h2>Experiments to reign in hunger</h2>
<p>The tactics below likely won’t surprise you. After all, they form the bedrock for solid nutrition and good overall health.</p>
<p>However, before you disregard them with a “been there, done that!” consider: <strong>How many of the below are you actually doing <em>consistently</em>? </strong></p>
<h3>Experiment #1: Add a protein serving</h3>
<p>It may seem counterintuitive to <em>add </em>a serving of food to your meals when you’re trying to eat <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>However, this one tactic may help reign in appetite and hunger.</p>
<p><strong>Protein takes longer to digest than does carbohydrate or fat, so it helps you feel full and satisfied for longer. </strong></p>
<p>In addition, you may find, as I did, that you’re not consuming anywhere near as much protein as you think. (Find out how much you need here: <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/will-a-high-protein-diet-harm-your-health">‘How much protein should I eat?’ Choose the right amount for fat loss, muscle, and health</a>)</p>
<p>Try one or both of the following:</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>Consume at least 1 to 2 portions of lean protein at every single meal</li>
<li>Prioritize snacks that contain protein—hard-boiled eggs, turkey sausage links, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese—instead sweets or chips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Experiment #2: Choose high-fiber carbohydrates over lower-fiber ones</h3>
<p><strong>Fibrous plant foods can help fill you up with fewer calories. </strong></p>
<p>To see the difference, you might monitor how you feel after consuming a near-zero-fiber food, such as your favorite assortment of snack chips. The following day, when it’s time for the same snack or side dish, opt for something with more fiber, such as roasted nuts, a side of beans, a salad, or a piece of fruit. Notice how the fiber-rich option affects your appetite and hunger for the next few hours.</p>
<p>Another experiment worth trying: Include one to two portions of produce with every meal you consume. Track your sensations of hunger to see if they make a dent.</p>
<h3>Experiment #3: Log between-meal indulgences</h3>
<p>You may be reaching for more snacky foods and beverages than you realize.</p>
<p>These foods don’t need to be 100 percent off-limits; you just want to be intentional about your consumption and portion sizes.</p>
<p>For a couple of weeks, keep track of alcohol, sweets, and treats that you eat <em>between</em> intentional meals and snacks.</p>
<p>Review your notes at the end of each day to see if these more impulsive or less mindful eating episodes align with your memory of what and how much you consumed.</p>
<h3>Experiment #4: Move after meals</h3>
<p>Increased inflammation coupled with decreased muscle mass, among other factors, leads many people to become more insulin-resistant with age.<sup>18</sup> Cells don’t respond as readily to the hormone, which means more glucose stays in the bloodstream rather than entering cells that can use it for energy.</p>
<p>Through a complex set of mechanisms, this can drive up hunger and overall appetite.</p>
<p>Consuming protein- and fiber-rich meals will help, as we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>So will movement. <strong>Walking for as little as two minutes after meals can help your body process the carbohydrates you consumed</strong>, improving blood sugar levels, finds research.<sup>19 20</sup></p>
<p>In addition, by removing yourself from your kitchen, you create a habit that helps to psychologically shift you away from “eating” and over to “the kitchen is closed.”</p>
<h2>Experiments for more energy</h2>
<p>To address midlife brain fog and fatigue, you’ll want to do all you can to encourage good sleep. In addition, see if the below suggestions make a difference.</p>
<h3>Experiment #1: Prioritize strength training over intense cardio</h3>
<p>This was a hard lesson for me because I <em>love</em> intense cardio.</p>
<p>However, now in my 50s, if I try to fit in two weekly strength training sessions <em>and </em>two weekly spin sessions, I feel drugged—as if someone spiked my coffee with tranquilizers.</p>
<p>When my Precision Nutrition health coach suggested I dial back on the cardio for a couple of weeks, I won’t lie. I thought about firing her.</p>
<p>But then I took her advice and rediscovered what it felt like to be alert.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: I still do cardio. But I’m smart about it. I now know that I can’t do everything, at peak intensity, <em>and</em> expect to feel rested and alert daily. There’s a balance.</p>
<p>Strength training is increasingly important at midlife to protect bone strength and maintain muscle mass. Aim for at least two weekly sessions. Then, fit in cardio around those sessions.</p>
<p>If you feel worn out, experiment with doing <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/zone-2-cardio">low- or moderate-intensity cardio</a> (like brisk walking, slow cycling, or swimming) over higher-intensity cardio (like an hour-long spin class).</p>
<p>Or, if you love higher intensities, keep doing them, but shorten your duration.</p>
<p>Or, just save those vigorous sessions for when you got great sleep the night before.</p>
<h3>Experiment #2: Try active recovery</h3>
<p>Active recovery can help increase blood circulation and the removal of waste products that may have built up in your muscles during intense exercise sessions.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>This can include light activities such as walking, swimming, yoga, or stretching. You can also try massage, foam rolling, or a long, hot bath.</p>
<h3>Experiment #3: Consider creatine</h3>
<p>Lots of folks think of creatine monohydrate as something people take to get jacked.</p>
<p>However, more and more evidence points to creatine’s benefits for people in midlife and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>The supplement may be especially helpful for muscle recovery. </strong></p>
<p>In research that pooled the data from 23 studies, study participants who took creatine experienced fewer indicators of muscle damage 48 to 90 hours after intense training than participants who didn’t supplement.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><strong>The supplement may also help you to think clearly, especially after a bad night of sleep</strong>, finds other research.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>Finally, by promoting cellular energy throughout the body (including the brain), creatine may help to blunt fatigue and boost mood.<sup>24 25</sup></p>
<p>A daily dose of three to five grams works for most people.</p>
<h2>The winning midlife mindset</h2>
<p>There’s one final experiment that I want to tell you about.</p>
<p><strong>It has to do with embracing a mindset of acceptance.</strong></p>
<p>Think back to other difficult phases of your life. For me, parenting an infant with colic comes to mind. Gosh, I was so tired back then that I likely would have forked over my entire 401k in exchange for one solid night of sleep.</p>
<p>However, I knew that the stage was temporary. That knowledge helped to keep me going.</p>
<p>Midlife can be similar.</p>
<p>You likely won’t weigh at 55 what you did at 25. That’s okay. However, the night sweats, brain fog, and fatigue are all fleeting. <strong>You will eventually establish a new normal. </strong></p>
<p>In the meantime, see if you can accept that your body may look and feel different now. Shift your focus <em>away</em> from trying to look and feel like your younger self and <em>toward</em> consistently embracing new behaviors that will help you age with strength, vitality, and contentment.</p>
<p>After all, you have much more control over your behavior than the number on the scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="reviewer">Reviewed by Denise Asafu-Adjei, M.D., MPH</p>
<hr class="top" />
<h3>A few years back, PN co-founder John Berardi, PhD, posted a shirtless photo of himself on his 47th birthday.</h3>
<p>He called it his “anti-regress pic” and thanked 30 years of squats, deadlifts, presses, and chin-ups—among other exercises—for his chiseled six-pack, pumped chest, and bulging biceps.</p>
<p>The question many commenters posed:</p>
<p><strong> “Are you on testosterone?”</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Berardi explained in a follow-up post that while he wasn’t against testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for people who needed it, he himself was not on this therapy, and his testosterone levels were boringly “normal.” He also offered <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSEc8VKssY8/">some thought-provoking ideas about testosterone and aging.</a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSEc8VKssY8/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145699" src="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta.png" alt="Photo of muscular middle-aged man with the caption: A few weeks back, on my 47th birthday, I posted a pic. Kinda like this one. Lots of questions about whether I’m on testosterone replacement therapy. My response… No, I’m not on TRT. Nothing against it. Especially if one needs it. But I don’t. My T is in the middle of normal (not high, not low). No symptoms. Happy with my physique. So it’s not required for me. Again, if it is for you, rock on. For me, though, don’t need it. But here’s the other thing… I’m sorta okay with diminishing testosterone.I have this weird theory that declining testosterone (within healthy ranges and without real clinical symptoms) can help men of a certain age transition into wise elder roles. Increasing amounts of patience, compassion, level-headedness. Slowness to anger, having a lower competitive drive, having lower aggression. These are the kinds of things I WANT as we raise our four children, take on more coaching and mentorship, and spend more time thinking about and serving others. All else being equal, I think lower(ish) testosterone might be an advantage here. Again, within healthy ranges and without pathology.”" width="1200" height="775" srcset="https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta.png 2104w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta-300x194.png 300w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta-1024x661.png 1024w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta-768x496.png 768w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta-1536x991.png 1536w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta-2048x1322.png 2048w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta-94x61.png 94w, https://assets.precisionnutrition.com/2024/08/jb-insta-295x190.png 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>Dr. Berardi’s take is the opposite of what you generally hear, especially these days when…</p>
<ul class="pn-list__spaced">
<li>The mainstream opinion seems to be that declining testosterone is a harbinger of aging, frailty, and impotence—not to mention a threat to masculinity.</li>
<li>Increasing numbers of middle-aged men are ditching traditional medical checkups for men’s-focused telehealth clinics that specialize in testosterone enhancement.<sup>1</sup></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/144397e/testosterone_optimization/">Reddit communities</a> have popped up solely to obsess over neuroscientist Andrew Huberman’s supplement recommendations for optimizing testosterone.</li>
<li>Media outlets pump out story after story about “testosterone boosting” foods to eat and “testosterone lowering” foods to avoid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re a coach who fields the “How do I optimize testosterone?” question from clients—or just a regular dude hoping to age well—it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and confused by the conflicting information.</p>
<p>Are declining testosterone levels normal?</p>
<p>Do testosterone-boosting supplement regimens actually work?</p>
<p>Who benefits from testosterone therapy—and who doesn’t?</p>
<p>In this story, we’ll explore those questions and more.</p>
<h2>What is testosterone?</h2>
<p>Secreted by the testes, testosterone is the sex hormone responsible for male sexual characteristics such as big muscles, deep voices, and hairy chests. It’s a chemical messenger that plays a key role in various processes throughout the body, including sperm production and bone density.</p>
<p>(In women, who also need testosterone to keep various processes humming, testosterone is secreted by the ovaries and adrenal glands. Their bodies just make much less of it; about 10 to 20 times less than men.)</p>
<p>Possibly because of its relationship with muscle growth and sex drive, a lot of cisgender men think of testosterone in binary terms, with lower testosterone being bad and higher testosterone being good.</p>
<p>However, <strong>it’s more accurate to think of the relationship between testosterone and health as a continuum</strong> that goes from too low (problematic) to too high (also problematic), with the healthy range falling between the two extremes, says Denise Asafu-Adjei, MD, MPH, urologist, men’s health expert, and assistant professor of urology at Loyola University Chicago-Stritch School of Medicine.</p>
<p>As the chart below shows, the dangers of extremely low testosterone are similar to the risks of extremely high amounts (typically only achievable with the use of anabolic steroids).</p>

<h3>Low testosterone vs. <em>lower </em>testosterone</h3>
<p>Testosterone levels naturally ebb with age, with most men losing about 1 to 2 percent annually starting around age 40. By age 75, most men have 30 percent less of the hormone than they did at age 25.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>(Fun fact: Between ages 25 and 80, men can expect their testicles to shrink 15 percent.<sup>3</sup>)</p>
<p><strong>However, age-related drops in testosterone are not the same thing as “low testosterone.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hypogonadism</strong> is the medical term for low testosterone levels, and it affects about 35 percent of men older than 45 and 30 to 50 percent of men who have obesity or type 2 diabetes, according to the Endocrine Society, one of the professional public health organizations that sets hypogonadism treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>Not only can overly low testosterone make you feel fatigued and do a serious number on your sex drive, but it can also harm your bone and cardiovascular health, says Dr. Asafu-Adjei.</p>
<p>“You need testosterone for good bone strength,” says Dr. Asafu-Adjei. “As you get older, you’re already dealing with weaker bones, so having lowered testosterone isn’t going to help.”</p>
<p>Alternatively, bringing levels up to normal seems to offer cardiovascular benefits, she says. (The big caveat here is up to <em>normal</em>—not far above it.)</p>
<h3>The importance of referring out</h3>
<p>What if you or your client have most of the hallmark symptoms of hypogonadism but still have blood levels of testosterone in the normal range?</p>
<p><strong>“Many men over 30 who feel down or low energy will now automatically blame their testosterone,”</strong> says Dr. Asafu-Adjei. “Their symptoms might be related to testosterone, but they also could be related to not sleeping, stress, or some other factor.”</p>
<p>That’s why seeing a healthcare professional specializing in men’s health and testosterone management is so important.</p>
<p>Such a physician can screen you or your client for dozens of other problems (like stress and poor sleep) and conditions (like diabetes, obesity, or sleep apnea) that either mimic the symptoms of hypogonadism or interfere with the production or signaling of testosterone.</p>
<p>In other words, supplemental testosterone is the answer for some men with symptoms of hypogonadism, but not all of them. An extensive workup is required.</p>
<p>“There are overlapping symptoms with low testosterone as well as a lot of nuances around hormone treatment,” says Dr. Asafu-Adjei.</p>
<p>“For example, outside of your total testosterone, we also look at your testosterone-to-estrogen ratio and other related hormones. That’s why it’s so important to go to someone who knows what they’re doing. They’ll take a deeper dive to figure out the root of the problem.”</p>
<p>So, if you specialize in coaching middle-aged and older men, get a urologist or endocrinologist in your referral network.</p>
<div class="callout_box"></p>
<h2>Testosterone and aggression</h2>
<p>Many people assume that, in high amounts, testosterone turns men into pushy, road-rage-fueled jerks. However, the association between the hormone and behavior is much more complex.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>As it turns out, both too much and too little testosterone can lead to irritability.</p>
<p>In addition, the link between testosterone and aggression depends a lot on someone’s personality, upbringing, context, social norms, and more.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1608085113#:~:text=Although%20in%20several%20species%20of,behaviors%20that%20enhance%20social%20status." target="_blank" rel="noopener">in one experiment</a>, researchers asked forty young men to play a video game that involved accepting and rejecting offers from a proposer. If someone deemed the proposal too low, they could reject the offer and punish the person for making such a substandard ask. Alternatively, if they considered the offer beneficial, they could accept it as well as reward the person.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Researchers injected some of the men with testosterone as they played the game.</p>
<p>As expected, players treated with the hormone were more likely to punish proposers, especially if they considered the offer unfair. However, if they perceived the offer as fair, they rewarded the proposer more generously.</p>
<p>The increased testosterone amplified aggression, but also generosity.</p>
<p>Some researchers refer to this phenomenon as “the male warrior hypothesis,” which holds that testosterone may function to help some men protect and cooperate with their “in group” (such as their family, friends, and coworkers) while simultaneously punishing anyone seen as an outsider.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p></div>
<h2>7 evidence-based ways to optimize testosterone… naturally</h2>
<p>On the Internet, if you look for ways to boost testosterone through lifestyle, you’ll quickly become inundated with supplement recommendations and lists of T-boosting and T-harming foods.</p>
<p>However, research-supported ways to optimize testosterone generally center on the fundamental dietary and lifestyle measures you’ve long heard are good for you.</p>
<p>They include the following:</p>
<h3>Testosterone optimizer #1: Make sure you’re eating enough.</h3>
<p>Your body prioritizes thinking (your brain) and movement (your muscles) above sex (your reproductive organs).</p>
<p>Think about it this way: If there was a famine, the last thing you’d need is another mouth to feed.</p>
<p>So, when you chronically burn more calories than you consume, hormone levels generally drop. (This is true in both men and women.)</p>
<p>“A lot of men in their 20s and 30s come to me about their low testosterone levels and their low testosterone symptoms,” says Dr. Berardi. “These are mostly guys who prioritize exercise. They work out a lot and watch what they eat. In other words, they are men experiencing mid- to long-term negative energy balance.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Berardi’s advice is often not what men expect. </strong></p>
<p>If their eating and exercise routines suggest they’re in a chronic negative energy situation, he simply recommends they eat an extra healthy snack or two a day.</p>
<p>“In situations like this, adding a couple hundred extra calories of high-quality protein and carbohydrate often fixes everything,” he says.</p>
<p>Those added calories could come from a couple scoops of whey protein mixed in milk with a nut butter and banana sandwich on the side, he says.</p>
<p>Another favorite snack of Dr. Berardi’s: A bowl of steel-cut oats with protein powder, cacao powder, dates, raw nuts, and nut butter.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Eating too much (and gaining fat) can also affect testosterone, as we’ll cover soon. Use our <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/nutrition-calculator">FREE nutrition calculator </a>to ensure you’re consuming the right amount of calories and nutrients to support hormone production.</p>
<h3>Testosterone optimizer #2: Prioritize sleep.</h3>
<p>Testosterone production has its own circadian rhythm: It’s higher in the morning and lower at the end of the day.</p>
<p>As you sleep, levels rise again, peaking during your first segment of rapid eye movement. This may explain why <strong>various sleep disorders—including sleep apnea—are associated with testosterone deficiency.</strong><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>A handful of small studies have looked at what happens to hormone levels when men skimp on sleep.<sup>8</sup> In one of these studies, participants slept just five hours a night for eight days, resulting in a 10 to 15 percent drop in daytime testosterone levels. <sup>9</sup></p>
<p>The right amount of sleep varies from one person to another. However, if you routinely get fewer than seven hours and wake feeling exhausted, it’s a good bet you’re not getting enough. If you wake unrefreshed or struggle to sleep soundly, our <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/how-to-sleep-better">14-day sleep plan can help</a>.</p>
<h3>Testosterone optimizer #3: Maintain healthy body fat levels.</h3>
<p>Body fat secretes aromatase, an enzyme that can convert some testosterone into estrogen.</p>
<p>According to some research, men categorized as overweight or obese tend to have slightly higher levels of estrogen, as well as the stress hormone cortisol. <sup>10 11</sup></p>
<p>More research is needed to know whether these slightly higher estrogen levels are enough to contribute to hypogonadism.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, a healthy body composition is vital for overall good health and may also help to optimize testosterone.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, as we said above, that too little body fat can also negatively affect testosterone levels. To ensure your body fat levels are in the optimal zone, use our <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/body-fat-calculator">FREE body fat calculator</a>.</p>
<h3>Testosterone optimizer #4: Get moving.</h3>
<p>Regular exercise is associated with elevations in testosterone. It can also help you sleep more restfully and keep body fat in check.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance training offers more of a testosterone boost than endurance exercise. </strong>(Two to three sessions a week is a great benchmark.)</p>
<p>However, endurance exercise can also help, providing you exercise at the right intensity, finds research. (That’s 30 minutes of rigorous activity, four to five times a week.<sup>12</sup>)</p>
<p><strong>Overtraining without enough recovery can lead to the opposite effect though, potentially causing gains to plateau and suppressing testosterone.</strong><sup>13</sup></p>
<p>(See our <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/video-exercise-library">FREE exercise library</a> for 400+ expert how-to videos and a 14-day at-home workout program.)</p>
<h3>Testosterone optimizer #5: Consume a well-rounded, healthy diet.</h3>
<p>In addition to helping you avoid nutrient deficiencies that can drive down testosterone levels, a healthy diet protects your blood vessels.</p>
<p>That’s crucial for getting erections.</p>
<p>A study of 21,469 men found that<strong> those who consumed foods consistent with the Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of developing erectile dysfunction</strong> over ten years compared to men who didn’t follow the diet.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>“Mediterranean diets are also known to promote heart health,” says Dr. Asafu-Adjei.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/mediterranean-diet-food-list">The Mediterranean diet</a> emphasizes fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, and healthy fats from foods like olive oil, eggs, and fatty fish. It de-emphasizes red and processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sodium.</p>
<p>However, eating patterns that center on minimally processed whole foods likely offer the same benefits.</p>
<p>Many fruits, veggies, and other minimally processed whole foods are rich sources of flavonoids, a plant chemical that helps to improve blood flow and testosterone production.</p>
<p>(This <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/what-should-i-eat-infographic">visual eating guide</a> can help you choose the best foods for your body.)</p>
<h3>Testosterone optimizer #6: Avoid chronic emotional stress.</h3>
<p>When you’re under stress, your body produces cortisol and other hormones that prepare you to fight, flee, or freeze. As these stress hormones flood your body, they suppress the production of reproductive hormones like testosterone.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>This high-cortisol, low-testosterone phenomenon is a likely consequence of millions of years of evolution.</p>
<p>Early humans who were more interested in mating than fleeing from sharp-clawed wild animals didn’t usually live long enough to pass their genes to the next generation.</p>
<p><strong>However, not all short-term stressors dampen testosterone. </strong>Some can raise it temporarily, including exam stress or exercise.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>So, aim for the stress sweet spot where you feel energized and engaged with life but not so busy and harried that you have no time to relax, sleep, or enjoy life.</p>

<h3>Testosterone optimizer #7: Prevent zinc deficiency.</h3>
<p>As a certified health coach, it’s out of your scope of practice to recommend supplements to treat a condition like hypogonadism.</p>
<p>In addition, the boost someone might get from a supplement pales in comparison to the six pieces of advice above, or to testosterone therapy.</p>
<p>With that important caveat out of the way…</p>
<p>There is a correlation between low zinc intake and low testosterone levels.<sup>17 18</sup></p>
<p>However, <strong>to benefit from supplementation, someone must truly be deficient in the mineral.</strong> Simply topping off someone’s already adequate zinc stores likely won’t lead to a testosterone boost, and may even cause harm.</p>
<p>Checking for and treating a mineral deficiency requires the expertise of someone trained in medical nutrition therapy. If you lack this training, encourage clients with low testosterone to talk to their healthcare professionals about whether a zinc supplement might help.</p>
<h2>Use the Deep Health lens</h2>
<p>Let’s circle back to Dr. Berardi’s hypothesis, first mentioned at the beginning of this story:</p>
<p>Some evolutionary biologists have indeed theorized that men evolved to have higher testosterone levels when they’re younger (to encourage mating) and lower levels when they’re older (to encourage parenting).<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>However, this is more of a theory than a certainty.</p>
<p>What we can say with certainty is this: There’s no one-size-fits-all protocol for healthy testosterone levels.</p>
<p>When testosterone drops after middle age, some men feel lousy.</p>
<p>Even when they do everything right in the lifestyle department—exercising, eating a healthy diet, sleeping enough, and so on—they’re unable to raise testosterone into the normal range. For these men, a healthcare professional, thorough evaluation, and, if warranted, testosterone therapy can be life-changing.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>plenty of other men continue to thrive well into (and past!) middle age.</strong></p>
<p>Sure, they may be unable to pack on muscle like they used to. But, if they’re paying attention, suggests Dr. Berardi, they might notice other pluses. Maybe they’re more patient, nurturing, and empathetic, for example.</p>
<p>“Don’t get me wrong. I’d be very unhappy with an inappropriate or clinically significant lowering of my hormone levels,” says Dr. Berardi. “However, if I can stay in the normal range and symptom-free with good lifestyle practices, I don’t think I have too much to worry about.”</p>
<p>Dr. Berardi recently turned 50.</p>
<p>“I’m at this stage where I see an interesting fork in the road,” he said.</p>
<p>“Will I gracefully accept aging and see this as a new season—or will I fight against it? I could color my hair, do hair transplants, top up my T levels, and get Botox injections. Or I could accept that there will be some eventual decline and ask, ‘What am I getting in return?’”</p>
