										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can raise BDNF levels in our brain by fasting and exercising, as well as by eating and avoiding certain foods.</p>
<p>There is accumulating evidence that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29387021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing</a> a role in human depression. BDNF <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controls</a> the growth of new nerve cells. “So, low levels of this peptide could lead to an atrophy of specific brain areas such as the amygdala and the hippocampus, as it has been observed among depressed patients.” That may be one of the reasons that exercise <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22548651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> so good for our brains. Start an hour-a-day exercise regimen, and, within three months, there <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19923361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can</a> be a quadrupling of BDNF release from our brain, as seen below and at 0:35 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-boost-brain-bdnf-levels-for-depression-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Boost Brain BDNF Levels for Depression Treatment</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114791" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-35-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>This makes sense. Any time we were desperate to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22548651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catch</a> prey (or desperate not to become prey ourselves), we needed to be cognitively sharp. So, when we’re fasting, exercising, or in a negative calorie balance, our brain starts churning out BDNF to make sure we’re firing on all cylinders. Of course, Big Pharma is eager to create drugs to mimic this effect, but is there any way to boost BDNF naturally? Yes, I just said it: fasting and exercising. Is there anything we can add to our diet to boost BDNF?</p>
<p>Higher intakes of dietary flavonoids appear to be protectively <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated</a> with symptoms of depression. The Harvard Nurses’ Health Study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27413131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed</a> tens of thousands of women for years and found that those who were consuming the most flavonoids appeared to reduce their risk of becoming depressed. Flavonoids occur naturally in plants, so there’s a substantial amount in a variety of healthy foods. But how do we know the benefits are from the flavonoids and not just from eating more healthfully in general? We put it to the test.</p>
<p>Some fruits and vegetables <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28035345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> more flavonoids than others. As shown below and at 1:51 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-boost-brain-bdnf-levels-for-depression-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, apples have more than apricots, plums more than peaches, red cabbage more than white, and kale more than cucumbers. Researchers randomized people into one of three groups: more high-flavonoid fruits and vegetables, more low-flavonoid fruits and vegetables, or no extra fruits and vegetables at all. After 18 weeks, only the high-flavonoid group got a significant boost in BDNF levels, which corresponded with an improvement in cognitive performance. The BDNF boost may help <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29759102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explain</a> why each additional daily serving of fruits or vegetables is associated with a 3 percent decrease in the risk of depression. </p>

<p>What’s more, as seen here and at 2:27 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-boost-brain-bdnf-levels-for-depression-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>, a teaspoon a day of the spice turmeric may <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost</a> BNDF levels by more than 50 percent within a month. This is consistent with the other randomized controlled trials that have so far been done. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114799" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-27-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Nuts may <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help</a>, too. In the PREDIMED study, where people were randomized to receive weekly batches of nuts or extra-virgin olive oil, the nut group lowered their risk of having low BDNF levels by 78 percent, as shown below and at 2:46.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114801" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-46-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And BDNF is not <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446461" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implicated</a> only in depression, but schizophrenia. When individuals with schizophrenia underwent a 12-week exercise program, they got a significant boost in their BDNF levels, which led the researchers to “suggest that exercise-induced modulation of BDNF may play an important role in developing non-pharmacological treatment for chronic schizophrenic patients.”</span></p>
<p>What about schizophrenia symptoms? Thirty individuals with schizophrenia were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19012672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randomized</a> to ramp up to 40 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week or not, and there did appear to be an improvement in psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations, as well as an increase in their quality of life, with exercise. In fact, researchers could actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visualize</a> what happened in their brains. Loss of brain volume in a certain region appears to be a feature of schizophrenia, but 30 minutes of exercise, three times a week, resulted in an increase of up to 20 percent in the size of that region within three months, as seen here and at 3:46 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-boost-brain-bdnf-levels-for-depression-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114803" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-46-1-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Caloric restriction may also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18582525" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase</a> BDNF levels in people with schizophrenia. So, researchers didn’t just have study participants eat less, but more healthfully, too—less saturated fat and sugar, and more fruits and veggies. The study <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/542b/4954547b280b2a12dcc3d0fa4525952cbda4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> like the Soviet fasting trials for schizophrenia that reported truly unbelievable results, supposedly restoring people to function, and described fasting as “an unparalleled achievement in the treatment of schizophrenia”—but part of the problem is that the diagnostic system the Soviets <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9853788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> is completely different than ours, making any results hard to interpret. There was a subgroup that seemed to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/887908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correspond</a> to the Western definition, but they still reported 40 to 60 percent improvement rates from fasting, but fasting wasn’t all they did. After the participants <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/542b/4954547b280b2a12dcc3d0fa4525952cbda4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fasted</a> for up to a month, they were put on a meat- and egg-free diet. So, when the researchers reported these remarkable effects even years later, they were for those individuals who stuck with the meat- and egg-free diet. Evidently, the closer the diet was followed, the better the effect, and those who broke the diet relapsed. The researchers noted: “Not all patients can remain vegetarian, but they must not take meat for at least six months, and then in very small portions.” We <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22333737" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> from randomized controlled trials that simply eschewing meat and eggs can improve mental states within just two weeks, so it’s hard to know what role fasting itself played in the reported improvements.</p>
<p>A single high-fat meal can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop</a> BDNF levels within hours of consumption, and we can prove it’s the fat itself by seeing the same result after injecting fat straight into our veins. Perhaps that helps explain why increased consumption of saturated fats in a high-fat diet may <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20670674" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribute</a> to brain dysfunction—that is, neurodegenerative diseases, long-term memory loss, and cognitive impairment. It may also help explain why the standard American diet has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked</a> to a higher risk of depression, as dietary factors modulate the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caloric restriction can boost levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is considered to play a critical role in mood disorders.</p>
<p>For more than a century, fasting has been <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25292424?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">espoused</a> as a treatment of supposed “great utility in the preservation of health,” especially rejuvenating the body and, above all, the mind. When people <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27597946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast</a> for even 18 hours, though, they may get hungry and irritable. After one or two days, positive mood goes down and negative mood <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26032787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goes</a> up, and after three days, fasters can increasingly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feel</a> sad, self-blame, and suffer a loss of libido. Then, something strange starts to happen: People <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a> a “fasting-induced mood enhancement…reflected by decreased anxiety, depression, fatigue, and improved vigor.” Studies <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23332541" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend</a> to show this across the board. Once you get over the hump, fasters frequently experience “an increased level of vigilance and a mood improvement, a subjective feeling of well-being, and sometimes of euphoria.” And, no wonder, as, by then, endorphin levels may <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2289782" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rise</a> by nearly 50 percent, as seen here and at 1:06 in my video <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-fasting-to-treat-depression/?queryID=77ad9b0dea3b91267dc314a055060a53" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Friday Favorites: Fasting to Treat Depression</strong></a>. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114773" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-06-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>This enhancement of mood, alertness, and calm <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes</a> a certain amount of evolutionary sense. Our body wants us to feel poorly initially so we continue to eat, day to day, when food is available, but if we go a couple of days without food, our body realizes we can’t just mope in our cave; we need to get motivated to go out and find some calories.</p>
<p>So, can fasting be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23332541" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> for mood disorders, like depression? It’s great that people can feel better after a few days of fasting, but the critical question revolves around the “persistence of mood improvement over time” once fasting ends and eating resumes. The little published evidence we have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/482552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes</a> out of Japan and the former Soviet Union, and some of it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14460891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> just ridiculous, like this study that included women with a variety of symptoms, which the researchers blame mostly on marital conflict, as you can see below and at 2:08 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-fasting-to-treat-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>. Husband not <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14460891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treating</a> you right? How about some “electroshock therapy”? That didn’t seem to help much, so what about “hunger therapy”? Of course, starving the women made them hungry, but that’s what Thorazine is for. If they keep getting injected with an antipsychotic to calm them down, they can sail right through. So, what happened in the study? What would we even do with those results? </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Another study, however, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/964029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skipped</a> the Thorazine. The participants fasted for ten days, but they were also kept in bed all day on “absolute bed rest,” completely <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/482552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isolated</a> and “prohibited from seeing other people except the attending doctor and nurse…also denied access to television, radio, newspapers or any other forms of information.” So, if people got better or worse, it would be impossible to tease out the effects of the fasting component on its own. But researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/964029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that they apparently did get better, with efficacy reportedly demonstrated in 31 out of 36 patients suffering from depression, as seen here and at 2:56 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-fasting-to-treat-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114777" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-56-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>The researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/964029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concluded</a> that fasting therapy may provide an alternative to the use of antidepressant drugs, “thinking the fasting therapy may be a kind of shock therapy.” People are so relieved to be eating again, to get out of solitary confinement, and to even just get out of bed that they report feeling better. That was at the time of discharge, though. How did they feel the next day, the next week, the next month? Fasting is, by definition, unsustainable, so what we want to ideally see are some kind of longer-lasting effects.</p>
<p>Researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/550177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did</a> a follow-up with a few hundred patients, not just a few months later, but after a few years. Of the 69 who were evidently suffering from depression, 90 percent reported feeling good or excellent results at the end of the ten-day fast, and, remarkably, years later, 87 percent of the 62 individuals who replied claimed that they were still doing well. Now, there was no control group, so we don’t know if they would have done just as well or even better without the fast, and it was all self-reporting, so there may have been a response bias where participants tried to please the researchers. Who knows? Maybe they were afraid they’d get sent back to solitary if they didn’t respond affirmatively. We have no idea, but we do have good evidence for the short-term mood benefits.</p>
<p>Why would fasting improve feelings of depression? In addition to the endorphins and the surge in serotonin, the so-called happiness hormone, when we <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast,</a> there is a bump in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is considered to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15145621" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play</a> a crucial role in mood disorders. Researchers have perked up rodents with it, but we aren’t rats or mice. What about us? Humans with major depression <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29387021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> lower levels of BDNF circulating in their bloodstream. Autopsy studies of suicide victims <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12912764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a> only about half the BDNF in certain key brain regions, compared to controls, suggesting it may play an important role in suicidal behavior, as seen here and at 4:38 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-fasting-to-treat-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15145621" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost</a> BDNF with antidepressant drugs and electroshock; we can also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19012000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost</a> it with caloric restriction. We can get a 70 percent boost in levels after three months of cutting 25 percent of calories out of our daily diet, as shown below and at 4:51.</span></p>

<p>Is there anything we can add to our diets to boost BNDF levels so we can get the benefits without the hunger? We’ll find out next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smoking cannabis may help with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the short term, but it may make the long-term prognosis worse.</p>
<p>As this study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24778478/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asks</a>, “Medical Marijuana: A Panacea or Scourge?” For 5,000 years, cannabis “has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22305029/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> throughout the world medically, recreationally, and spiritually.” It was even prescribed by American physicians “for a plethora of indications” from the mid-19th century to the 1930s, a fact that’s often <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14723476/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> by medical marijuana proponents as evidence justifying the modern medical applications.” But the field of old-timey medicine is “fraught with potions and herbal remedies,” not to mention bloodletting and other questionable and harmful remedies.</p>
<p>Skeptics criticize the medical marijuana movement as the “‘medical excuse marijuana’ movement,” insinuating that children with epilepsy and the terminally ill are being “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26339208/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> as a ‘Trojan horse’ for the legalization of recreational cannabis use” or to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26398734/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peddle</a> “outlandish claims” about “miracle cancer cures,” frustrating researchers in the field who just want to get at the science.</p>
<p>For example, what about the therapeutic use of cannabis for inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis? Conventional therapies <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28035196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work</a> mainly by suppressing the immune system to try to tamp down inflammation. “Given the limited therapy options and known adverse side effects with chronic use” from these drugs, people suffering from these diseases often need to have inflamed sections of their bowels removed surgically, so it’s clear why there’s so much interest in alternative approaches.</p>
<p>About one in six IBD patients who use marijuana say it helps with their symptoms, so researchers decided to put it to the test. Thirteen patients with IBD were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22095142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given</a> a third of a pound of marijuana to smoke at their leisure over a period of three months, and they reported feeling significantly better with “reported improvement in general health perception, social functioning, ability to work, physical pain, and depression.” There wasn’t a control group, so it’s unknown if they would have improved anyway or what role the placebo effect may have played. It’s like some of the studies of cannabis <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25845492/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> for pediatric epilepsy that had response rates exceeding 30 percent and a frequency cut in half in a third of the kids. Amazing results until you realize you can sometimes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21956725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> similarly amazing responses from giving kids nothing but a sugar pill placebo, as seen below and at 2:21 in my video <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-cannabis-for-inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Friday Favorites: Cannabis for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</strong></a>. That’s why it’s critical to do randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, but there weren’t any on cannabis and IBD until 2013. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114766" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-21-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>For 21 patients with Crohn’s disease, nothing seemed to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23648372/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help</a>. So researchers randomized them to either smoke two joints a day of marijuana or a look-alike placebo. The results? Ninety percent of those in the cannabis group got better, compared to only 40 percent in the placebo group. Shown below and at 3:11 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-cannabis-for-inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong> is a graph of their symptom scores. As you can see, there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23648372/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> no big change in the placebo group over the two-month study, but the cannabis group cut their symptoms by about half. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114768" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-11-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>The researchers acknowledge that long-term cannabis use is not without risks, but it may be a cakewalk compared to the potential adverse—and even life-threatening—side effects of some of the more powerful conventional therapies, so the study was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26832655/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heralded</a> in a paper entitled “High Hope for Medical Marijuana in Digestive Disorders.”</p>
<p>The study was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28035196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded</a> by a medical marijuana advocacy organization, the main supplier in the country, in fact. So, expectations may have been placed on the participants about how much better they would feel—in other words, they may have been primed for the placebo effect. But the researchers controlled for that, right? Those getting the real cannabis did significantly better than those randomized to get the placebo. But the point of a placebo is that it is indistinguishable from the real thing, so the participants don’t know which group they’re in—the control group or the treatment group. How can that be accomplished with a psychoactive drug? It can’t, which is the problem. The researchers tried to hide which group participants were in by only recruiting patients who had never tried cannabis before in the hopes that they wouldn’t notice placebo pot, but, unsurprisingly, most of them did. So, we’re basically <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2013.11.016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> with another unblinded study. The researchers asked a bunch of subjective questions, like “How are you feeling?” and those who pretty much knew they were taking the drug said they were feeling better.</p>
<p>There <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28035196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> no significant changes in objective lab values, like CRP, a sign of inflammation, so perhaps the “cannabis may simply be masking symptoms without affecting intestinal inflammation.” Another indicator that it may not be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24161351/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affecting</a> the course of the disease itself is how quickly the symptoms rebound. Two weeks after the study ended, those in the cannabis group were right back to where they started, as shown here (see week 10) and at 5:05 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-cannabis-for-inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114770" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/5-05-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>So, “there <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2013.11.016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> no difference in objective inflammatory markers to indicate disease modification. Given the rapid rebound…to pretreatment levels after the 2-week washout period, it seems more plausible that cannabis ameliorated the symptoms of Crohn’s disease, rather than actually modulating the disease.” That may be, but the symptoms are terrible. A reduction in pain is a reduction in pain. Indeed, “from the point of view of the patients, a marked symptomatic improvement and ability to resume normal life is not trivial, even if inflammation persists.” Of course, what if cannabis somehow makes the disease worse in the long run?</p>
<p>A survey study published the following year found that cannabis <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24407485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> the same immediate symptomatic relief but was associated with a worse disease prognosis over time. Patients with IBD reported that cannabis improved their pain, cramping, and diarrhea, but use for more than six months by Crohn’s patients appeared to be a strong predictor of them ending up in surgery; they had five times the odds of going under the knife. There are two possible explanations for this: It’s quite possible that the increased disease severity led to the cannabis use and not the other way around. The alternative explanation: “Cannabis use may worsen the prognosis of IBD, leading to greater surgeries and hospitalizations.”</p>
<p>This is why we need prospective clinical trials where people are followed over time to see which came first. Until then, perhaps we should consider cannabis use for IBD as “potentially harmful.” Not just to err on the side of caution, but because there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18166478/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> a study on hepatitis C patients that found that daily cannabis use was associated with nearly seven times the odds of worse liver fibrosis, which is like scar tissue. If cannabis really does <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24407485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make</a> fibrosis worse, that may explain why cannabis users with IBD may be more likely to require surgery. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Women with breast cancer should include the “liberal culinary use of cruciferous vegetables.” Both the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study and the Women’s Health Initiative study [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women with breast cancer should include the “liberal culinary use of cruciferous vegetables.”</p>
<p>Both the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study and the Women’s Health Initiative study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17179478/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> that women randomized to a lower-fat diet <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enjoyed</a> improved breast cancer survival. However, in the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study, women with breast cancer were also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17635889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randomized</a> to drop their fat intake down to 15 to 20 percent of calories, yet there was no difference in breast cancer relapse or death after seven years.</p>
<p>Any time there’s an unexpected result, you must question whether the participants actually followed through with study instructions. For instance, if you randomized people to stop smoking and they ended up with the same lung cancer rates as those in the group who weren’t instructed to quit, one likely explanation is that the group told to stop smoking didn’t actually stop. In the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study, both the dietary intervention group and the control group started out at about 30 percent of calories from fat. Then, the diet group was told to lower their fat intake to 15 to 20 percent of calories. By the end of the study, they had in fact gone from 28.5 percent fat to 28.9 percent fat, as you can see below and at 1:16 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-food-that-can-downregulate-a-metastatic-cancer-gene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Food That Can Downregulate a Metastatic Cancer Gene</a></strong>. They didn’t even <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17635889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce</a> their fat intake. No wonder they didn’t experience any breast cancer benefit. </p>

<p>When you <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24606431/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put</a> together all the trials on the effect of lower-fat diets on breast cancer survival, even including that flawed study, you see a reduced risk of breast cancer relapse and a reduced risk of death. In conclusion, going on a low-fat diet after a breast cancer diagnosis “can improve breast cancer survival by reducing the risk of recurrence.” We may now know why: by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting</a> metastasis-initiating cancer cells through the fat receptor CD36.</p>
<p>We know that the cancer-spreading receptor is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26000608/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upregulated</a> by saturated fat. Is there anything in our diet that can downregulate it? Broccoli.</p>
<p>Broccoli appears to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26865652/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decrease</a> CD36 expression by as much as 35 percent (in mice). Of all fruits and vegetables, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli were the only ones <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28338764/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated</a> with significantly less total risk of cancer and not just getting cancer in the first place, as you can see here and at 2:19 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-food-that-can-downregulate-a-metastatic-cancer-gene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114759" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-19-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Those with bladder cancer who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20551305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat</a> broccoli also appear to live longer than those who don’t, and those with lung cancer who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25988580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat</a> more cruciferous veggies appear to survive longer, too.</p>
<p>For example, as you can see below and at 2:45 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-food-that-can-downregulate-a-metastatic-cancer-gene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, one year out, about 75 percent of lung cancer patients <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25988580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating</a> more than one serving of cruciferous vegetables a day were still alive (the top line in red), whereas, by then, most who had been getting less than half a serving a day had already died from their cancer (the bottom line in green).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114761" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/2-45-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Ovarian cancer, too. Intake of cruciferous vegetables “signiﬁcantly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20184987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored</a> survival,” whereas “a survival disadvantage was shown for meats.” Milk also appeared to double the risk of dying. Below and at 3:21 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-food-that-can-downregulate-a-metastatic-cancer-gene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong> are the survival graphs. Eight years out, about 40 percent of ovarian cancer patients who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20184987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averaged</a> meat or milk every day were deceased (the boldest line, on the bottom), compared to only about 20 percent who had meat or milk only a few times a week at most (the faintest line, on the top). </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114763" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/3-21-1-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Now, it could be that the fat and cholesterol in meat increased circulating estrogen levels, or it could be because of meat’s growth hormones or all its carcinogens. And galactose, the sugar naturally found in milk, may be directly toxic to the ovary. Dairy has all its hormones, too. However, the lowering of risk with broccoli and the increasing of risk with meat and dairy are also consistent with the CD36 mechanism of cancer spread.</p>
<p>Researchers put it to the test in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31250356/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given</a> pulverized broccoli sprouts or a placebo. The average death rate was lower in the broccoli sprout group compared to the placebo group. After a month, 18 percent of the placebo group had died, but none in the broccoli group. By three months, another 25 percent of the placebo group had died, but still not a single death in the broccoli group. And by six months, 43 percent of the remaining patients in the placebo group were deceased, along with the first 25 percent of the broccoli group. Unfortunately, even though the capsules for both groups looked the same, “true blinding was not possible,” and the patients knew which group they were in “because the pulverized broccoli sprouts could be easily distinguished from the methylcellulose [placebo] through their characteristic smell and taste.” So, we can’t discount the placebo effect. What’s more, the study participants weren’t properly randomized “because many of the patients refused to participate unless they were placed into the [active] treatment group.” That’s understandable, but it makes for a less rigorous result. A little broccoli can’t hurt, though, and it may help. It’s the lack of downsides of broccoli consumption that leads to “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30247957/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advising</a> Women Undergoing Treatment for Breast Cancer” to include the “liberal culinary use of cruciferous vegetables,” for example.</p>
<p>It’s the same for reducing saturated fat. The title of an editorial in a journal of the National Cancer Institute asked: “Is It Time to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pky066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Give</a> Breast Cancer Patients a Prescription for a Low-Fat Diet?” “Although counseling women to consume a healthy diet after breast cancer diagnosis is certainly warranted for general health, the existing data still fall a bit short of proving this will help reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality.” But what do we have to lose? After all, it’s still certainly warranted for general health.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Randomized controlled trials show that lowering saturated fat intake can lead to improved breast cancer survival. The leading cause of cancer-related death is metastasis. Cancer [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Randomized controlled trials show that lowering saturated fat intake can lead to improved breast cancer survival.</p>
<p>The leading cause of cancer-related death <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31202687/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> metastasis. Cancer kills because cancer spreads. The five-year survival rate for women with localized breast cancer <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30050121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> nearly 99 percent, for example, but that falls to only 27 percent in women with metastasized cancer. Yet, “our ability to eﬀectively <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31202687/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treat</a> metastatic disease has not changed signiﬁcantly in the past few decades&#8230;” The desperation is evident when there are such papers as “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29189742/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Targeting</a> Metastasis with Snake Toxins: Molecular Mechanisms.”</p>
<p>We <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28810142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> built-in defenses, natural killer cells that roam the body, killing off budding tumors. But, as I’ve discussed, there’s a fat receptor <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> CD36 that appears to be essential for cancer cells to spread, and these cancer cells respond to dietary fat intake, but not all fat.</p>
<p>CD36 is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26000608/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upregulated</a> by palmitic acid, as much as a 50-fold increase within 12 hours of consumption, as shown below and at 1:13 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-help-control-cancer-metastasis-with-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Help Control Cancer Metastasis with Diet</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114752" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/1-13-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Palmitic acid <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29167646/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> a saturated fat made from palm oil that can be found in junk food, but it is most concentrated in meat and dairy. This may <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25692500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explain</a> why, when looking at breast cancer mortality and dietary fat, &#8220;there was no difference in risk of breast-cancer-speciﬁc death…for women in the highest versus the lowest category of total fat intake,” but there’s about a 50 percent greater likelihood of dying of breast cancer with higher intake of saturated fat. Researchers conclude: “These meta-analyses have shown that saturated fat intake negatively impacts breast cancer survival.”</span></p>
<p>This may also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23492346/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explain</a> why “intake of high-fat dairy, but not low-fat dairy, was related to a higher risk of mortality after breast cancer diagnosis.” If a protein in dairy, like casein, was the problem, skim milk might be even worse, but that wasn’t the case. It’s the saturated butterfat, perhaps because it triggered that cancer-spreading mechanism induced by CD36. Women who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23818391/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumed</a> one or more daily servings of high-fat dairy had about a 50 percent higher risk of dying from breast cancer.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28187509/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see</a> the same with dairy and its relationship to prostate cancer survival. Researchers found that “drinking high-fat milk increased the risk of dying from prostate cancer by as much as 600% in patients with localized prostate cancer. Low-fat milk was not associated with such an increase in risk.” So, it seems to be the animal fat, rather than the animal protein, and these findings are consistent with analyses from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS), conducted by Harvard researchers.</p>
<p>There is even more evidence that the fat receptor CD36 is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31202687/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved</a>. The “risk of colorectal cancer for meat consumption” increased from a doubling to an octupling—that is, the odds of getting cancer multiplied eightfold for those who carry a specific type of CD36 gene. So, “Is It Time to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pky066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Give</a> Breast Cancer Patients a Prescription for a Low-Fat Diet?” A cancer diagnosis <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25692500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> often referred to as a ‘teachable moment’ when patients are motivated to make changes to their lifestyle, and so provision of evidence-based guidelines is essential.”</p>
<p>In a randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trial, researchers set out “to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17179478/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test</a> the effect of a dietary intervention designed to reduce fat intake in women with resected, early-stage breast cancer,” meaning the women had had their breast cancer surgically removed. As shown below and at 4:02 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-help-control-cancer-metastasis-with-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, the study participants in the dietary intervention group <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17179478/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> their fat intake from about 30 percent of calories down to 20 percent, reduced their saturated fat intake by about 40 percent, and maintained it for five years. “After approximately 5 years of follow-up, women in the dietary intervention group had a 24% lower risk of relapse”—a 24-percent lower risk of the cancer coming back—“than those in the control group.” </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114754" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402.png" alt="" width="1860" height="1031" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402.png 1860w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402-960x532.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402-1024x568.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402-768x426.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402-1536x851.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402-1200x665.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402-720x399.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/402-540x299.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1860px) 100vw, 1860px" /></p>
<p>That was the WINS study, the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study. Then there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> the Women’s Health Initiative study, where, again, women were randomized to lower their fat intake down to 20 percent of calories, and, again, “those randomized to a low-fat dietary pattern had increased breast cancer overall survival. Meaning: A dietary change may be able to influence breast cancer outcome.” What’s more, not only was their breast cancer survival significantly greater, but the women also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxz107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced</a> a reduction in heart disease and a reduction in diabetes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palmitic acid, a saturated fat concentrated in meat and dairy, can boost the metastatic potential of cancer cells through the fat receptor CD36.</p>
<p>The leading cause of death in cancer patients is metastasis formation. That’s how most people die of cancer—not from the primary tumor, but the cancer spreading through the body. “It is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdx327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that metastasis is responsible for ~90% of cancer deaths,” and little progress has been made in stopping the spread, despite our modern medical armamentarium. In fact, we can sometimes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29971590/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make</a> matters worse. In an editorial entitled “Therapy-Induced Metastasis,” its authors “provide evidence that all the common therapies, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, fine needle biopsies, surgical procedures and anaesthesia, have the potential to contribute to tumour progression.” You can imagine how cutting around a tumor and severing blood vessels might lead to the “migration of residual tumour cells,” but why chemotherapy? How might chemo <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30373101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exacerbate</a> metastases? “Despite reducing the size of primary tumors, chemotherapy changes the tumor microenvironment”—its surrounding tissues—“resulting in an increased escape of cancer cells into the blood stream.” Sometimes, chemo, surgery, and radiation are entirely justified, but, again, other times, these treatments can make matters worse. If only we had a way to treat the cause of the cancer&#8217;s spreading.</p>
<p>The development of antimetastatic therapies has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hampered</a> by the fact that the cells that initiate metastasis remain unidentified. Then, a landmark study was published: “Targeting Metastasis-Initiating Cells Through the Fatty Acid Receptor CD36.” Researchers found a subpopulation of human cancer cells “unique in their ability to initiate metastasis”; they all express high levels of a fat receptor known as CD36, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28127046/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dubbed</a> “the fat controller.” It turns out that palmitic acid or a high-fat diet specifically <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosts</a> the metastatic potential of these cancer cells. Where is palmitic acid found? Although it was originally <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29167646/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> in palm oil, palmitic acid is most concentrated in meat and dairy. “Emerging evidence <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03092-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows</a> that palmitic acid (PA), a common fatty acid in the human diet, serves as a signaling molecule regulating the progression and development of many diseases at the molecular level.” It is the saturated fat that is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recognized</a> by CD36 receptors on cancer cells, and we know it is to blame, because if the CD36 receptor is blocked, so are metastases.</p>
<p>The study was of a human cancer, but it was a human cancer implanted into mice. However, clinically (meaning in cancer patients themselves), the presence of these CD36-studded metastasis-initiating cells does indeed correlate with a poor prognosis. CD36 appears to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24737733/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive</a> the progression of brain tumors, for example. As seen in the survival curves shown below and at 3:21 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-cancer-to-metastasize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Causes Cancer to Metastasize?</a></strong>, those with tumors with less CD36 expression <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24737733/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lived</a> significantly longer. It <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41389-018-0107-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> the same with breast cancer mortality: “In this study, we correlated the mortality of breast cancer patients to tumor CD36 expression levels.” That isn’t a surprise, since “CD36 plays a critical role in proliferation, migration and…growth of…breast cancer cells.” If we inhibit CD36, we can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31847105/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inhibit</a> “the migration and invasion of the breast cancer cells.” </p>

<p>This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t</a> only in “human melanoma- and breast cancer–derived tumours” either. Now we suspect that “CD36 expression <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29398710/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drives</a> ovarian cancer progression and metastasis,” too, since we can inhibit ovarian cancer cell invasion and migration, as well as block both lymph node and blood-borne metastasis, by blocking CD36. We also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30728288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see</a> the same kind of effect with prostate cancer; suppress the uptake of fat by prostate cancer cells and suppress the tumor. This was all studied with receptor-blocking drugs and antibodies in a laboratory setting, though. If these “metastasis-initiating cancer cells particularly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rely</a> on dietary lipids [fat] to promote metastasis,” the spread of cancer, why not just block the dietary fat in the first place?</p>
<p>“Lipid metabolism <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28178563/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fuels</a> cancer’s spread.” Cancer cells love fat and cholesterol. The reason is that so much energy is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stored</a> in fat. “Hence, CD36+ metastatic cells might take advantage of this feature to obtain the high amount of energy that is likely to be required for them to anchor and survive at sites distant from the primary tumour”—to set up shop throughout the body.</p>
<p>“The time when glucose [sugar] was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28403011/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered</a> as the major, if not only, fuel to support cancer cell proliferation is over.” There appears to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28258602/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be</a> “a fatter way to metastasize.” No wonder high-fat diets (HFD) may “play a crucial role in increasing the risk of different cancer types, and a number of clinical studies have linked HFD with several advanced cancers.”</p>
<p>If dietary fat may be “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.11.010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greasing</a> the wheels of the cancer machine,” might there be “speciﬁc dietary regimens” we could use to starve cancers of dietary fat? You don’t know until you put it to the test, which we’ll look at next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For three cents a day, black cumin may improve our cholesterol and triglyceride levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar control, as well as accelerate the loss of body fat.</p>
<p>Black cumin, also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23646296/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known</a> as Nigella sativa or simply “black seed,” is not related to cumin; it’s a member of the buttercup family rather than the carrot family. Black cumin, with its peppery flavor, is a spice commonly used in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines, but it’s also been prized for its purported medicinal benefits. Described as “a miracle herb,” with mentions going back to the Old Testament, it was found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285793972_Medicinal_and_pharmacological_potential_of_Nigella_sativa_A_review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cached</a> in King Tut’s tomb, and it’s been reported that the “Islamic prophet Muhammad once stated that the black seed can heal every disease except death.” Only in the last 50 years or so has it been put to the test, though, culminating in more than a thousand papers published in the medical literature.</p>
<p>Typical doses used in studies are one or two grams a day, which is only about a quarter teaspoon. This enables researchers to perform randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials by putting the whole-food spice powder into capsules rather than studying a component or extract.</p>
<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26875640/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that daily black cumin consumption significantly improves cholesterol and triglycerides. Researchers also found that it not only <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27512971/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improves</a> blood pressure, but it also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29154069/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improves</a> blood sugar control. Some of the results are quite extraordinary. For example, one study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24685020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that postmenopausal women randomized to a gram a day (less than a quarter teaspoon) of black cumin powder reduced their LDL cholesterol by 27 percent within two months, significantly better than placebo. Those are the kinds of results we’d expect from a statin drug, yet it was achieved with just a sprinkle’s worth of a simple spice. Black cumin may also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25859301/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help</a> with menopausal symptoms.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn’t appear to cure anything—a month after stopping the spice, cholesterol levels began to creep back up, for instance, as you can see below and at 2:00 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-benefits-of-black-cumin-seed-nigella-sativa-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benefits of Black Cumin Seed (Nigella Sativa) for Weight Loss</a></strong>—but it does appear to be a cheap, safe, effective, and delicious (if you like spice) treatment for some of our deadliest risk factors. And its side effects <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26875640/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> loss of appetite and weight loss! </p>

<p>The latest systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled weight-loss trials <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2018.04.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that about a quarter teaspoon of black cumin powder a day does appear to cause weight loss within a span of a few months. If it really can benefit so many facets of health, why don’t we hear more about it? Why wasn’t I taught about it in medical school? Maybe because there’s little profit motive. Black cumin is just a common, natural spice. The daily dose used in most of these studies would cost about three cents a day. Stockholders won’t be thrilled to sell something that can’t be patented and costs only three pennies a day. Black cumin has become a staple in my family’s daily diet. I keep a pepper mill filled with it right on the kitchen table and grind it onto foods just as I would black pepper—easy and delicious.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are the risks versus benefits of drinking kombucha?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-kombucha-tea-goodfor-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Kombucha Tea Good for You?</a></strong> is one of my first videos. It was featured in a blog entry entitled “NutritionFacts.org: the first month,” where I marveled the video had reached nearly 100,000 people. You can see it below and at 0:20 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-kombuchas-side-effects-is-it-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kombucha’s Side Effects: Is It Bad for You?</a></strong>. I’m honored to say that we now reach more than 100,000 people <em>a day</em>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114729" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/07/0-20-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>In that first kombucha video, I profiled a report <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19460826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> in the <em>Journal of Intensive Care Medicine</em> of “a case of kombucha tea toxicity” in which a young man ended up in an acidotic coma. The authors concluded, “While Kombucha tea is considered a healthy elixir, the limited evidence currently available raises considerable concern that it may pose serious health risks. Consumption of this tea should be discouraged, as it may be associated with life-threatening lactic acidosis.” And this was just one of several case reports of “serious, and sometimes fatal, hepatic [liver] dysfunction and lactic acidosis within close proximity of ingestion.”</p>
<p>For example, there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7476846/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> two cases in Iowa of severe metabolic acidosis, including one death. There was also a triggering of a life-threatening autoimmune muscle disease that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15293100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required</a> emergency surgery and was “probably related to the consumption of a fermented Kombucha beverage.” Another patient <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9346462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> with shortness of breath, shaking, and a movement disorder “after consumption of tea and no other medications,” and a middle-aged woman complained of xerostomia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, and neck pain,” and her symptoms recurred on reingestion of the tea. There <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29197835/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> another case of severe metabolic lactic acidosis, as well as a case of hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26882579/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolved</a> after stopping kombucha.</p>
<p>Why these sporadic cases? Maybe some unusual toxins <a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/591869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed</a> in a particular batch. I mean, it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7486385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> a fermented product, so it’s possible there was just some contamination by a bad bug, like the time people <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9820255/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smeared</a> kombucha on their skin because they were told it had “magical healing power.” What it had instead was anthrax. So, even though such reports were rare, I concluded ten years ago that we should probably stick to foods that haven’t put people in a coma. But what about its risks versus benefits? Maybe kombucha is worth it. After all, it’s “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7486385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputed</a> to cure cancer,” “eliminate wrinkles,” “and even restore gray hair to its original color”—as “marketed by alternative and naturopathic healers throughout the United States.”</p>
<p>“Currently, kombucha is alternately <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praised</a> as ‘the ultimate health drink’ or damned as ‘unsafe medicinal tea.’” It’s been “<a href="http://agro.icm.edu.pl/agro/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-6aba02c2-c1eb-498f-b335-9624364ff73c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> to be a universal wonderful drug…a potion which improves awareness and concentration, slimming, also purifying, regenerating and life extending.” Which is it? <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30068458/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is</a> it “potion or poison?</p>
<p>Back in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, there were several medical studies <a href="http://agro.icm.edu.pl/agro/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-6aba02c2-c1eb-498f-b335-9624364ff73c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted</a> by recognized physicians confirming all sorts of beneficial effects, as you can see below and at 2:55 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/kombuchas-side-effects-is-it-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I couldn’t wait to read them. Dufrense and Farnworth were <a href="http://agro.icm.edu.pl/agro/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-6aba02c2-c1eb-498f-b335-9624364ff73c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited</a>, and when I went to that paper, I saw the same claim, citing Allen 1998. When I went to that source, I saw the citation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815201131/http:/persweb.direct.ca/chaugen/kombucha_faq_home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> for a random kombucha website, as shown below, and at 3:10 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/kombuchas-side-effects-is-it-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. And guess what? That website’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815201131/http:/persweb.direct.ca/chaugen/kombucha_faq_home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been</a> defunct since 2001, and “much of the Kombucha information” posted came from comments on some mailing list.</span></p>

<p>Finally, in 2003, a systematic review of the clinical evidence that had been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12808367/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> was conducted. “The main result of this systematic review, it seems, is the total lack of efficacy data…No clinical studies were found relating to the efficacy of this remedy.” We just have these cautionary tales, these case reports. So, based on these data, it was concluded that the largely undetermined benefits do not outweigh the documented risks of kombucha. It can therefore not be recommended for therapeutic use.” That was back in 2003, though. How about a 2019 systematic review of the empirical evidence of human health beneﬁt?</p>
<p>“The nonhuman subjects literature <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2018.11.001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> numerous health beneﬁts of kombucha,” with “nonhuman” meaning mice and rats. We need human clinical trials, yet there is still not a single controlled human study. (I did <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Effect+of+Fermented+tea+on+the+blood+sugar+levels+of+NIDDM+Subjects&amp;author=Hiremath,+U.S.&amp;author=Vaidehi,+M.P.&amp;author=Mushtari,+B.J.&amp;publication_year=2002&amp;journal=Indian+Pract.&amp;volume=55&amp;pages=423–425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find</a> one uncontrolled study purporting to show a signiﬁcant reduction in fasting and after-meal blood sugars among individuals with type 2 diabetes, though, as seen below and at 4:19 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/kombuchas-side-effects-is-it-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>.)</p>

<p>“Nonetheless,” despite no controlled trials, “signiﬁcant commercial shelf space is now <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2018.11.001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated</a> to kombucha products, and there is widespread belief that the products promote health.” So, we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12808367/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> left with this extreme disparity between science and belief: “There is no convincingly positive clinical evidence at all; the [health] claims for it are as far-reaching as they are implausible; the potential for harm seems considerable. In such extreme cases, healthcare professionals should discourage consumers from using (and paying for) remedies that only seem to benefit those who sell them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What were the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a daily half teaspoon of powdered black cumin in Hashimoto&#8217;s patients?</p>
<p>“Autoimmune thyroiditis, also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19818584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known</a> as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, is an organ-speciﬁc autoimmune disorder,” where our body attacks our own thyroid gland, often leading to hypothyroidism due to destruction and scarring of the gland itself. We know there’s a genetic component, since identical twins are more likely to share the disease than fraternal twins. “However, even with identical twins, the concordance rate was only about 50%, emphasizing that important factors such as the environment play a role in disease pathogenesis.” Indeed, even if your identical twin, who has basically your exact same DNA, has the disease, there’s only like a flip of a coin’s chance you’ll get it. Genes load the gun, but the environment may pull the trigger.</p>
<p>More than 90 synthetic chemicals were noted to show disruption of hormonal balance or thyroid dysfunction.” However, only a few such &#8216;pollutants show evidence that they contribute to autoimmune thyroid disease.” These include polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Smokers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7927844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> a lot of them from cigarettes, but in nonsmokers, exposure comes almost entirely from food, as you can see below and at 1:18 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-for-hypothyroidism-a-natural-treatment-for-hashimotos-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diet for Hypothyroidism: A Natural Treatment for Hashimoto’s Disease</a></strong>. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are primarily <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22132129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formed</a> when muscle meats, such as beef, pork, fish, or chicken, are cooked using high-temperature methods, such as grilling. PBBs, polybrominated biphenols, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19818584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> a type of flame-retardant chemical no longer manufactured in the United States, but are still <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0749-0720(15)30210-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> in the aquatic food chain. PCBs, polychlorinated biphenols, are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19818584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> in a number of industrial processes and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30464877/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end</a> up in people’s bodies, again, largely through the consumption of fish, but also eggs and other meats, as seen here and at 1:41 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-for-hypothyroidism-a-natural-treatment-for-hashimotos-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114163" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-41-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>So, one might suspect those eating plant-based diets would have lower rates of hypothyroidism, and, indeed, despite their lower iodine intake, vegan diets <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24264226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended</a> to be protective. But they’ve never been put to the test in an interventional trial. A modification of the Paleolithic diet has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31275780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried</a> in Hashimoto’s patients, but it didn’t appear to improve thyroid function. What did, though, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2016.03.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> <em>Nigella Sativa</em>. That name should sound familiar to anyone who’s read my book <em>How Not to Diet</em> or watched my live Evidence-Based Weight Loss presentation. <em>Nigella Sativa</em> is the scientific name for black cumin, which is just a simple spice that’s also used for a variety of medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>In one study, Hashimoto’s patients received a half teaspoon of powdered black cumin every day for eight weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Not only was there a signiﬁcant reduction in body weight, which is why I profiled it in my book, but the black cumin also signiﬁcantly reduced the thyroid-stimulating hormone, a sign that thyroid function was improving. It even lowered the level of autoimmune anti-thyroid antibodies, as well as increased blood levels of thyroid hormone T3 in these Hashimoto’s patients. In addition, there was a significant drop in Interleukin 23, a proinflammatory cell signal thought to help promote the autoimmune inﬂammation of the thyroid, which “further conﬁrms the anti-inﬂammatory nature of the plant.” And what were the side effects? There <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-018-0704-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> a 17 percent drop in “bad” LDL cholesterol, as shown below and at 3:19 in my<a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/diet-for-hypothyroidism-a-natural-treatment-for-hashimotos-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> video</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114165" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/3-19-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Given the fact that patients with Hashimoto’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25272307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may</a> be at particularly high risk of developing heart disease, this is exactly the kind of side effects we’d want. “Considering these health-promoting effects of N. Sativa [black cumin], it can be <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2016.03.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered</a> as a therapeutic approach in the management of Hashimoto-related metabolic abnormalities.”</span></p>
<p>A similar trial <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334361421_Effect_of_Nigella_sativa_on_thyroid_function_in_patients_with_hypothyroidism_treated_with_levothyroxine_a_triple-blind_randomized_controlled_trial_Medical_Science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed</a> to find a benefit, though. Same dose, same time frame, but no significant changes in thyroid function. In contrast with the previous study, though, the study participants were not all Hashimoto’s patients, but rather hypothyroid for any reason, and that may have diluted the results. And it’s possible that telling patients to take the black cumin doses with their thyroid hormone replacement therapy may have interfered with its absorption, which is an issue similar to other foods and drugs, and why patients are normally told to take it on an empty stomach. Since there are no downsides—it’s just a simple spice—I figure, why not give it a try? The worst that can happen is you’ll have tastier food.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s Note:</strong></p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about thyroid function, and I am glad to have been able to do this series. If you missed any of the other videos, see the related posts below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is the apparent protection of plant-based diets for thyroid health due to the exclusion of animal foods, the benefits of plant foods, or both?</p>
<p>Several autoimmune diseases <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29407432/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affect</a> the thyroid gland, and Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are the most common. Graves’ disease results in hyperthyroidism, an overactive thyroid gland. Though slaughter plants are supposed to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2012-title9-vol2/CFR-2012-title9-vol2-sec310-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remove</a> animals’ thyroid glands as they “shall not be used for human food,” should some neck meat slip in, you can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28361645/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffer</a> a similar syndrome called Hamburger thyrotoxicosis. That isn’t from your body making too much thyroid hormone, though. Rather, it’s from your body eating too much thyroid hormone. Graves’ disease <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25263477/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> much more common, and meat-free diets may be able to help with both diseases, as plant-based diets may be associated with a low prevalence of autoimmune disease in general, as observed, for example, in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Maybe it’s because plants are packed with “high amounts of antioxidants, possible protective factors against autoimmune disease,” or because they’re packed with anti-inflammatory compounds. After all, “consuming whole, plant-based foods <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29035175/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> synonymous with an anti-inflammatory diet.” But you don’t know until you put it to the test.</p>
<p>It turns out that the “exclusion of all animal foods was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25263477/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated</a> with half the prevalence of hyperthyroidism compared with omnivorous diets. Lacto-ovo [dairy-and-egg] and pesco [fish] vegetarian diets were associated with intermediate protection.” But, for those eating strictly plant-based, there is a 52 percent lower odds of hyperthyroidism.</p>
<p>As I discuss in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-diet-for-hypothyroidism-and-hyperthyroidism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Diet for Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism</a></strong>, this apparent protection “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25263477/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may</a> be due to the exclusion of animal foods, the [beneficial] effects of plant foods, or both. Animal foods like meat, eggs, and dairy products may contain high oestrogen concentrations, which have been linked to autoimmunity in cell and animal studies.” Or it could be because the decrease in animal protein by excluding animal foods may downregulate IGF-1, which is not just a cancer-promoting growth hormone, but may play a role in autoimmune diseases. The protection could also come from the goodness in plants that may “protect cells against autoimmune processes,” like the polyphenol phytochemicals, such as ﬂavonoids found in plant foods. Maybe it’s because environmental toxins build up in the food chain. For example, fish <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.05.132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contaminated</a> with industrial pollutants, like PCBs, are associated with an increased frequency of thyroid disorders.</p>
<p>But what about the other autoimmune thyroid disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, which, assuming you’re getting enough iodine, is the primary cause of hypothyroidism, an underactive thyroid gland? Graves’ disease <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25263477/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t</a> the only autoimmune disorder that was rare or virtually unknown among those living in rural sub-Saharan Africa, eating near-vegan diets. They also appeared to have less Hashimoto’s.</p>
<p>There <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26340971/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> evidence that those with Hashimoto’s have compromised antioxidant status, but we don’t know if it’s cause or effect. But if you look at the dietary factors associated with blood levels of autoimmune anti-thyroid antibodies, animal fats seem to be<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29143786/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> associated</a> with higher levels, whereas vegetables and other plant foods are associated with lower levels. So, again, anti-inflammatory diets may be useful. It’s no surprise, as Hashimoto’s is an inflammatory disease—that’s what thyroiditis means: inflammation of the thyroid gland.</p>
<p>Another possibility <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/C8FO00685G" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> the reduction in intake of methionine, an amino acid concentrated in animal protein, thought to be one reason why “regular consumption of whole-food vegan diets is likely to have a favourable influence on longevity through decreasing the risk of cancer, coronary [heart] disease, and diabetes.” Methionine restriction improves thyroid function in mice, but it has yet to be put to the test for Hashimoto’s in humans.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30294759/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compare</a> the poop of patients with Hashimoto’s to controls, the condition appears to be related to a clear reduction in the concentration of Prevotella species. Prevotella are good fiber-eating bugs known to enhance anti-inflammatory activities. Decreased Prevotella levels <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29320965/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> also something you see in other autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. How do you <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2017.08.101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> more Prevotella? Eat more plants. If a vegetarian <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24336217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goes</a> on a diet of meat, eggs, and dairy, within as few as four days, their levels can drop. So, one would expect those eating plant-based diets to have less Hashimoto’s, but in a previous video, I expressed concern about insufficient iodine intake, which could also lead to hypothyroidism. So, which is it? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>“In conclusion, a vegan diet <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24264226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended</a> to be associated with lower, not higher, risk of hypothyroid disease.” Why “tended”? The associated protection against hypothyroidism incidence and prevalence studies did not reach statistical significance. It wasn’t just because they were slimmer either. The lower risk existed even after controlling for body weight. So, researchers think it might be because animal products may induce inflammation. The question I have is: If someone who already has Hashimoto’s, what happens if they change their diet? That’s exactly what I’ll explore next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much nori, dulse, or arame approximates the recommended daily allowance for iodine?</p>
<p>Dairy milk <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29221567/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supplies</a> between a quarter and a half of the daily iodine requirement in the United States, though milk itself has “little native iodine.” The iodine content in cow’s milk is mainly determined by factors like “the application of iodine-containing teat disinfectants,” and the “iodine residues in milk <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24185833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originate</a> mainly from the contamination of the teat surface&#8230;” Indeed, the teats of dairy cows are typically <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22192200/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sprayed</a> or dipped with betadine-type disinfectants, and the iodine just kind of leaches into their milk, as you can see at 0:35 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-the-healthiest-natural-source-of-iodine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friday Favorites: The Healthiest Natural Source of Iodine</a></strong>. </p>

<p>Too bad most of the plant-based milks on the market aren’t <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27358189/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enriched</a> with iodine, too. Fortified soy milk <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmz115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> probably the healthiest of the plant milks, but even if it were enriched with iodine, what about the effects soy may <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16571087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> on thyroid function? When I searched the medical literature on soy and thyroid, this study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30627032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popped</a> up: “A Cost-Effective, Easily Available Tofu Model for Training Residents in Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Thyroid Nodule Targeting Punctures”—an economical way to train residents to do thyroid biopsies by sticking the ultrasound probe right on top a block of tofu and get to business, as you can see below and at 1:10 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-the-healthiest-natural-source-of-iodine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30627032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turns</a> out that our thyroid gland looks a lot like tofu on ultrasound.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114145" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/1-10-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Anyway, “the idea that soya may inﬂuence thyroid function <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26450571/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originated</a> over eight decades ago when marked thyroid enlargement was seen in rats fed raw soybeans.” (People living in Asian countries have consumed soy foods for centuries, though, “with no perceptible thyrotoxic effects,” which certainly suggests their safety.) The bottom line is that there does not <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16571087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seem</a> to be a problem for people who have normal thyroid function. However, soy foods may inhibit the oral absorption of Synthroid and other thyroid hormone replacement drugs, but so <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19942153/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do</a> all foods. That’s why we tell patients to take it on an empty stomach. But you also have to be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16571087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> enough iodine, so it may be particularly “important for soy food consumers to make sure their intake of iodine is adequate.”</p>
<p>What’s the best way to get iodine? For those who <a href="https://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/may-2019/vol-12-issue-5-p-3-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use</a> table salt, make sure it’s iodized. “Currently, only 53% of salt sold for use in homes contains iodine, and salt used in processed foods typically is not iodized.” Ideally, we shouldn’t add any salt at all, of course, since it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24786439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> “a public health hazard.” A paper was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19573007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">titled</a>: “Salt, the Neglected Silent Killer.” Think it’s a little over the top? Dietary salt <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30954305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> the number one dietary risk factor for death on planet Earth, wiping out more than three million people a year, twice as bad as not eating your vegetables, as you can see here and at 2:38 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-the-healthiest-natural-source-of-iodine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114147" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-38-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>In that case, what’s the best source of iodine then? Sea vegetables, as you can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30258574/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see</a> below and at 2:50. We can get a little iodine here and there from a whole variety of foods, but the most concentrated source by far is seaweed. We can get up to nearly 2,000 percent of our daily allowance in just a single gram, about the weight of a paperclip. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114149" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-50-1-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Given that iodine is extensively <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-803968-7.00042-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stored</a> in the thyroid, it can safely be consumed intermittently,” meaning we don’t have to get it every day, “which makes seaweed use in a range of foods attractive and occasional seaweed intake enough to ensure iodine sufficiency.” However, some seaweed has overly high iodine content, like kelp, and should be used with caution. Too much iodine can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31517826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause</a> hyperthyroidism, a hyperactive thyroid gland. A woman presented with a racing heartbeat, insomnia, anxiety, and weight loss, thanks to taking just two tablets containing kelp a day.</span></p>
<p>In my last video, I noted how the average urinary iodine level of vegans <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21613354/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> less than the ideal levels, but there was one kelp-eating vegan with a urinary concentration over 9,000 mcg/liter. Adequate intake is when you’re <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29986412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peeing</a> out 100 to 199 mcg/liter, and excessive iodine intake is when you break 300 mcg/liter. Clearly, 9,437 mcg/liter is way too much. <br />
 <br />
As you can see below and at 3:57 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-the-healthiest-natural-source-of-iodine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, the recommended average daily intake <a href="https://doi.org/10.17226/11537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> 150 mcg per day for non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding adults, and we may want to <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/UL_Summary_tables.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay</a> below 600 mcg a day on a day-to-day basis, but a tablespoon of kelp may <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30258574/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contain</a> about 2,000 mcg. So, I’d stay away from kelp because it has too much iodine, and I’d also stay away from hijiki because it contains too much arsenic. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If iodine is concentrated in marine foods, “this </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem;" href="https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-019-0043-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raises</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> the question of how early hominins living in continental areas could have met their iodine requirements.” What do bonobos do?

					<description><![CDATA[Most plant-based milks are not fortified with iodine. “Adequate dietary iodine is required for normal thyroid function.” In fact, the two thyroid hormones are named [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most plant-based milks are not fortified with iodine.</p>
<p>“Adequate dietary iodine is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21613354/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required</a> for normal thyroid function.” In fact, the two thyroid hormones are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-803968-7.00042-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named</a> after how many iodine atoms they contain: T3 and T4. “Given that iodine is extensively stored in the thyroid gland itself, it can safely be consumed intermittently,” so we don’t need to consume it every day. However, our overall diet does need a good source of it. Unfortunately, the common sources <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27244854/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t</a> particularly health-promoting: iodized salt and dairy foods. (Iodine-based cleansers like betadine are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-803968-7.00042-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> on cows “to sanitize the udders, resulting in leaching of iodine in the milk.”) Iodine may also be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27244854/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> to cattle feed, and some commercially produced breads contain food additives with iodine.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28901333/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put</a> people on a paleo-type diet and cut out their dairy and table salt, they can develop an iodine deficiency, even though they double their intake of seafood, which can also be a source of iodine. What about those switching to diets centered around whole plant foods? They also cut down on ice cream and Wonder Bread, and if they aren’t eating anything from the sea, like seaweed or other sea vegetables, they can run into the same problem.</p>
<p>A three-year-old’s parents <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30141344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> striving to feed her only the healthiest foods, and her diet included only plant-based, unsalted, and unseasoned foods. She got no unprocessed foods, but she also got no vitamin supplementation, which could be deadly. Without vitamin B12, those on strictly plant-based diets can develop irreversible nerve damage, but in this case, a goiter arose first, due to inadequate iodine intake.</p>
<p>In another case of “veganism as a cause of iodine-deficient hypothyroidism,” a toddler <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29303778/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became</a> ill after weaning. Before weaning, he was fine because his mother kept taking her prenatal vitamins, which fortunately contained iodine.</p>
<p>Most vegetarians and vegans <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-803968-7.00042-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> apparently unaware of the importance of iodine intake during pregnancy, “for the neurodevelopment of the unborn child, similar to their omnivorous counterparts.” The American Thyroid Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have <a href="https://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/may-2019/vol-12-issue-5-p-3-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended</a> that women, even just planning on getting pregnant, should take a daily supplement containing 150 micrograms (mcg) of iodine, yet only 60 percent of prenatal vitamins marketed in the United States contain this essential mineral. So, despite the recommendations, about 40 percent of prenatal vitamins don’t contain it. “Therefore, it is extremely important that women, especially when pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy, read the labels of their multivitamin supplements to ensure that they are receiving an adequate amount of iodine.”</p>
<p>Women of reproductive age <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29986412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> an average iodine level of 110 mcg/liter, which <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21613354/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> fine for nonpregnant individuals, but we’d really like women to get at least 150 mcg/liter during pregnancy. (It’s basically a 24-hour urine test, in which iodine sufficiency is defined as 100 mcg/liter of urine in nonpregnant adults; the average vegan failed to reach this in the largest study done to date, one out of Boston.)</p>
<p>The recommended average daily intake <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27358189/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> 150 mcg per day for most people, which we can get in about a cup and a half of cow’s milk. Regrettably, plant-based milks aren’t typically fortified with iodine and average only about 3 mcg per cup. Although many plant-based milks are fortiﬁed with calcium, researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28946925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> in the largest systematic study to date that only 3 out of 47 were fortiﬁed with iodine. Those that were fortified had as much as cow’s milk, but those that weren’t fell short, as you can see at 3:30 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Are Vegans at Risk for Iodine Deficiency?</a></strong>. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Plant-based milk companies <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28946925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brag</a> about enriching their milks with calcium and often vitamins B12, D, and A, but only rarely are attempts made to match iodine content. The only reason cow’s milk <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29303778/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has</a> so much is that producers enrich the animals’ feed or it comes dripping off their udders. So, why don’t plant-milk companies add iodine, too? I was told by a food scientist at Silk that my carrageenan video played a role in the company switching to another thickener. Hopefully, Silk will see this video, too, and consider adding iodine, or maybe another company will snatch the opportunity for a market advantage. </span> </p>
<p>The researchers conclude that individuals who consume plant-based milks not fortified with iodine may be at risk for iodine deﬁciency, unless they consume alternative dietary iodine sources, the healthiest of which are sea vegetables, which we’ll cover next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How effective are flu shots, elderberries, echinacea, and cranberries?</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/rr/rr6803a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends</a> that everyone over the age of six months get a routine flu shot every year, unless you have some sort of contraindication, such as an allergy to any of the vaccine’s components. CDC recommends getting vaccinated by the end of October, but it may even be beneficial when received in December or later. How effective are flu vaccines? It <a href="https://nutritionfacts.box.com/s/wttxggocw8u4wmhokpdcjzhkqvt6dyo0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depends</a> on the year, but, as you can see below and at 0:33 in my video <a href="http://nutritionfacts.org/video/elderberry-benefits-and-side-effects-does-it-help-with-colds-and-the%20flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Friday Favorites: Elderberry Benefits and Side Effects: Does It Help with Colds and the Flu?</strong></a>, the flu vaccine typically <a href="https://nutritionfacts.box.com/s/wttxggocw8u4wmhokpdcjzhkqvt6dyo0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces</a> the risk of getting the flu by about 40 to 50 percent.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">So, in healthy adults, we </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem;" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29388196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> say with moderate certainty that we can decrease our risk of influenza from about 2 percent each year down to just under 1 percent. Older adults may </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem;" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29388197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> a similar relative risk reduction, but the baseline risk is higher and the consequences greater, so the absolute benefits are greater, too. In kids, flu vaccines </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem;" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29388195/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shine</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">; there’s a high certainty of evidence of a substantial drop in risk. But even in this kind of best-case scenario, there’s still a risk with vaccination, so what else can we do?</span></p>
<p>In the United States alone, each year, Americans <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30670267/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a> millions of cases of inﬂuenza and hundreds of millions of colds. What about elderberry supplements? In a test tube, elderberry extracts can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21352539/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inhibit</a> pathogens, including the flu virus. In a petri dish, it can <a href="https://www.jle.com/en/revues/ecn/e-docs/the_effect_of_sambucol_a_black_elderberry_based_natural_product_on_the_production_of_human_cytokines_i._inflammatory_cytokines_90261/article.phtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rev</a> up the production of flu-fighting molecules from human immune system cells, like tumor necrosis factor, as much as nearly 45-fold. Elderberry juice can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22972323/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help</a> mice fight off the flu. But what about actual people?</p>
<p>The first clinical trial was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9395631/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> back in the 1990s: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to treat flu-like symptoms. Researchers found that the odds for improvement before the fifth day in those in the treated group were more than 20 times the odds of the participants in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Two subsequent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15080016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> similar accelerated healing in the elderberry groups, as you can <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pilot-Clinical-Study-on-a-Proprietary-Elderberry-%3A/367d1c92716b6be462f26dbfe6c223863dc78464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see</a> here and at 1:54 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-elderberry-benefits-and-side-effects-does-it-help-with-colds-and-the-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I was excited to see this study—“Elderberry Supplementation <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/8/4/182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reduces</a> Cold Duration and Symptoms in Air-Travelers”—given a 200-city book tour I was embarking on. It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 312 economy class passengers. While taking elderberry didn’t seem to prevent people from coming down with cold symptoms, the duration and severity of symptoms in those who did get a cold seemed to have been lessened, and they suffered an average of about five days instead of seven.</span></p>
<p>A similar study using the herb echinacea <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22229040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a lessening of symptom scores, but it was of only borderline statistical significance. Nevertheless, even though most of the individual trials didn’t <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31126553/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find</a> statistically significant improvements, when all such studies were compiled, it seems there may be about a 20 percent decrease incidence of colds, as seen below and at 2:50 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-elderberry-benefits-and-side-effects-does-it-help-with-colds-and-the-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Note, though, that there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31126553/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> a concern about publication bias and selective reporting. A number of findings and some entire studies seem to be MIA, suggesting that negative studies may have been quietly shelved. So, we aren’t really sure about echinacea, but all the elderberry studies seem to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30670267/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> positive results, suggesting elderberry supplementation “provides an eﬀective treatment option when advanced or more invasive care [more serious treatment] is not warranted.” This conclusion came from someone with apparent conflicts of interest, though. In fact, each of the four elderberry studies was funded by the elderberry product companies themselves.</span></p>
<p>Any other berries that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464617304383?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might</a> be helpful? A randomized, placebo-controlled, interventional study—<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330619/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded</a>, predictably, by Ocean Spray—found that the gamma-delta-T-cells of those drinking a low-calorie cranberry juice beverage for ten weeks appeared to be proliferating at nearly fivefold the rate. These immune cells “serve as a first line of defense.” Though the study participants didn’t get fewer colds, they did seem to suffer less, but not enough to prevent days missed from work or an impairment of their activities, as shown here and at 3:56 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-elderberry-benefits-and-side-effects-does-it-help-with-colds-and-the-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">At least cranberries have never been reported to<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31571105/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> cause</a> pancreatitis. A man taking an elderberry extract not only suffered an attack of acute pancreatitis, a sudden painful inflammation of the pancreas, but it went away when he stopped it, then reappeared again years later when he tried taking it again, which suggests cause-and-effect. Why take elderberry extracts when you can just eat the elderberries themselves? Well, cooked are fine, but “consuming uncooked blue or black elderberries can <a href="https://secure.medicalletter.org/w1566f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause</a> nausea and vomiting.”</span></p>
<p>I found out the hard way, as I explained in an answer to the question, “What was the worst day of your life?” in my London Real interview on my <em>How Not to Die</em> book tour. It turns out elderberry fruits <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.2740330516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">form</a> cyanide, such that eight people had to be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000311.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medevacked</a> out after someone brought freshly squeezed elderberry juice to a gathering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide, physical inactivity accounts for more than 10 million years of healthy life lost, but what we</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accounts for </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32353572/"><b>nearly 20 times</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that. As I discuss in my video </span><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/fewer-than-1-in-5000-meet-sodium-and-potassium-recommended-intakes/"><b>Fewer Than 1 in 5,000 Meet Sodium and Potassium Recommended Intakes</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unhealthy diets shave hundreds of millions of disability-free years off people’s lives every year. What are the worst aspects of our diets? Four out of the five of the </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(19)30041-8/fulltext"><b>deadliest</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dietary traps involve not eating enough of certain foods—not eating enough whole grains, fruits, nuts, seeds, and vegetables—but our most fatal flaw is getting too much salt. To put things into perspective, our overconsumption of salt is on the order of 15 times deadlier than diets too high in soda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our bodies are meant to have a certain balance of sodium and potassium intake, yet many people, including the majority in the United States, get vastly more sodium and far less potassium than the recommended amounts. Indeed, sodium and potassium goals are currently met by less than 0.015 percent of the U.S. population—close to 99.99 percent noncompliance, with only </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22760562/"><b>1 in 6,000 Americans</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hitting the recommended guidelines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>What’s So Bad About Salt?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all the terrible things about our diets, high dietary sodium intake—that is, high salt intake—is the leading risk, estimated to be causing </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31553515/"><b>millions of deaths</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every year mainly through adverse effects on blood pressure and increased risks of stroke, heart attack, and kidney damage. Hypertension, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28031983/"><b>known commonly</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as high blood pressure, is called the “silent and invisible killer” because it rarely causes symptoms but is one of the most powerful independent predictors of some of our leading causes of death. I discuss this in my video </span><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/are-potassium-chloride-salt-substitutes-effective/"><b>Are Potassium Chloride Salt Substitutes Effective?</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>How Much Sodium Is Healthy in a Day?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our bodies</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10918987/"><b> evolved</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to handle only about 750 milligrams of sodium a day. Nevertheless, the American Heart Association calls for us to stay under 1,500 milligrams, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">twice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that amount. However, we’re consuming more than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">four times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what’s natural, and it’s only </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31103645/"><b>getting</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worse, having increased over the last couple of decades. An eye-opening 98.8 percent of Americans </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854410/"><b>exceed</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even that elevated 1,500 milligrams threshold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Daily Potassium Intake</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many of us are consuming too much sodium, we may also be getting too little potassium, a mineral that lowers blood pressure. Less than 2 percent of U.S. adults, for instance, consume the recommended daily minimum intake of potassium based on chronic disease prevention. So, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854410/"><b>more than 98 percent</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans may eat potassium-deficient diets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This deﬁciency is even more striking when </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26948054/"><b>comparing</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our current intake with that of our ancestors, who consumed large amounts of dietary potassium. We evolved probably getting more than 10,000 milligrams of potassium a day. The recommendation was to get about half that amount, yet most of us don’t come anywhere close.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Why Are So Many of Us Lacking in Potassium?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29301002/"><b>evolved</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consuming a diet very rich in potassium and low in sodium, but, today, this pattern has been reversed. The flip reﬂects a shift away from traditional plant-based diets high in potassium and low in sodium towards the standard American diet. I’m talking about a </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26948054/"><b>shift</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> away from fruits, greens, roots, and tubers to an eating pattern filled with salty, processed foods stripped of potassium.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Why Do We Need Potassium?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low potassium intake has been implicated in high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, and several </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27792643/"><b>meta-analyses</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have conﬁrmed that high potassium intake appears to reduce the risk of stroke. It follows that potassium is now considered a “nutrient of public health concern” because most Americans don’t reach the recommended </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily intake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>What Is the Best Substitute for Salt?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potassium chloride, which is often found in zero-sodium salt substitutes. We know from randomized controlled trials that </span><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m315"><b>sodium reduction</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leads to blood pressure reduction and </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28419159/"><b>increasing potassium</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intake can also lower blood pressure. So should we be “salting” our food with potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>What Is Potassium Chloride? Is It a Viable (and Tasty) Salt Substitute?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potassium chloride is a </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27110818/"><b>naturally occurring</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mineral salt, which is obtained the same way we get regular sodium salt. Since we get too much sodium and not enough potassium, this would seem to make potassium chloride a win-win solution. Consider these examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a randomized controlled trial, households had just 25 percent of the sodium chloride </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32066973/"><b>salt replaced</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with potassium chloride. At that level, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28031983/"><b>most people</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> either can’t tell the difference or even prefer the salt with the potassium mixed in. The findings? The use of the salt substitute with one-quarter potassium chloride was associated with cutting the risk of developing hypertension in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">half</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16762939/"><b>study</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, five kitchens in a veterans’ retirement home were randomized into two groups for about two and a half years. They either salted their meals with regular salt or, unbeknownst to the cooks and the diners alike, a 50/50 blend of potassium chloride. Those in the half-potassium group cut their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by about 40 percent and lived up to nearly one year longer. The life expectancy difference at age 70 was equivalent to that which would have naturally occurred in 14 years––meaning that just switching to half potassium salt appeared to effectively make people more than a decade younger when it came to risk of death.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Side Effects of Potassium Chloride?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I discuss in my video </span><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/potassium-chloride-salt-substitute-side-effects/"><b>Potassium Chloride Salt Substitute Side Effects</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, potassium chloride is “generally regarded as safe” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jch.13482"><b>Healthy individuals</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t have to worry about getting too much potassium because their kidneys excrete any excess in urine, but that’s with </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838902/"><b>potassium in food</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What about supplements? </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28031983/"><b>No adverse effects</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been shown for long-term intakes of potassium supplements as high as 3,000 milligrams a day, and blood levels of potassium are maintained in the normal range by </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26948054/"><b>healthy kidneys</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even when potassium intake is increased to approximately 15,000 milligrams a day. This isn’t surprising, given that we evolved eating so many healthy plant foods, so many fruits and vegetables, rich in potassium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838902/"><b>normal range</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for potassium levels in the blood is between 3.5 and 5.0. There are a </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jch.13482"><b>small number of individuals</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who may run into problems, primarily those with severely impaired kidney function. That’s why there’s been such a reluctance to push potassium</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‐</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">based salt substitutes on a population level. Serious issues may arise if your kidneys can’t regulate your potassium. There may be </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838902/"><b>concern</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you have known kidney disease, diabetes (diabetes can lead to kidney damage), severe heart failure, or adrenal insufficiency, or if you’re an older adult or on medications that impair potassium excretion. If you aren’t sure if you’re at risk, ask your doctor about getting your kidney function tested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National and international health organizations have </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31553515/"><b>called for warning</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> labels on salt packets and salt shakers, with messages like “too much sodium in the diet causes high blood pressure and increases risk of stomach cancer, stroke, heart disease, and kidney disease. Limit your use.” So, pass (on) the salt shaker and try some potassium chloride instead.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[More than 95 percent of human exposure to industrial pollutants like dioxins and PCBs comes from fish, other meat, and dairy. By cultivating muscle meat [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 95 percent of human exposure to industrial pollutants like dioxins and PCBs comes from fish, other meat, and dairy.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3551074/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultivating</a> muscle meat directly, without associated organs like intestines, the incidence of foodborne diseases “could be significantly reduced,” as could exposure to antibiotics, “pesticides, arsenic, dioxins, and hormones associated with conventional meat.” Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231238" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> seven hormone drugs to bulk up the production of milk and meat. “In the European Union, there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11505585/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exists</a> a total ban on such use,” however. Even without injected hormones, though, animal products naturally have hormones because they come from animals. “Eggs, example given, contribute more to the dietary intake of estradiol [estrogens] than beef, whether the animal is legally treated with hormones or not.” After all, eggs come straight from a hen’s ovaries, so, of course, they’re swimming with hormones. But if you’re directly growing just muscle meat or egg white protein, you don’t need to include reproductive organs, adrenal glands, or any of the associated hormones.</p>
<p>“Chemical safety <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-4337.12473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> another concern for meat produced under current production systems.” There are chemical toxicants and industrial pollutants that build up in the food chain, such as pesticides, PCBs, heavy metals, and ﬂame retardants, but there is no food chain with cultivated meat. We could produce all the tuna we wanted, with zero mercury.</p>
<p>When the World Health Organization <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determined</a> that processed meat was a known human carcinogen and unprocessed meat a probable human carcinogen, it wasn’t even talking about the carcinogenic environmental pollutants. When researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25659303/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested</a> retail meat for the presence of “33 chemicals with calculated carcinogenic potential,” like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides like DDT, and dioxin-like PCBs, they <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concluded</a> that, in order to reduce the risk of cancer, we should limit beef, pork, or chicken consumption to a maximum of five servings a month.</p>
<p>Why cultivate meat at all when you can just buy organic? Surprisingly, “consumption of organic meat does not <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25893622/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diminish</a> the carcinogenic potential associated with the intake of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).” A number of studies have recently <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30682385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared</a> the presence of environmental contaminants in organic meat versus conventional meat, and the researchers found, surprisingly, that organic meat was sometimes more contaminated. Not only organic beef either. Higher levels were also found in pork and poultry.</p>
<p>If you look at the micropollutants and chemical residues in both organic and conventional meat, several environmental contaminants, including dioxins, PCBs, lead, and arsenic, were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490068/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measured</a> at signiﬁcantly higher levels in the organic samples. As you can see below and at 2:56 in my video, <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-chemical-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Human Health Effects of Cultivated Meat: Chemical Safety</strong></a>, the green <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29061317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> organic meat, and the blue is conventional. </p>

<p>Cooking helps to draw off some of the fat where the PCBs are concentrated, as shown here and at 3:01.</p>

<p>Seafood seems to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29787848" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be</a> an exception. Steaming, for example, generally increases contaminant levels, increasing contaminant exposure and concentrating mercury levels as much as 47 percent, as you can see here and at 3:15 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-chemical-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. Better not to have toxic buildup in the first place.</p>

<p>More than 95 percent of human exposure to industrial pollutants like dioxins and PCBs <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31147261/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes</a> from foods like meat, including fatty fish, and dairy, but the pollutants don’t appear magically. The only way the chicken, fish, and other meat lead to human exposure is because the animals themselves built up a lifetime of exposure in our polluted world, from incinerators, power plants, sewer sludge, and on and on, as you can see here and at 3:40 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-chemical-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Unlike conventional meat production, a slaughter-free harvest would not only <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-4337.12473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mean</a> no more infected animals, but no more contaminated animals either. In terms of pollutants, it would be like taking a time machine back before the Industrial Revolution.</span></p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s Note:</strong></p>
<p>Cultivated meat means less contamination with fecal residues, toxic pollutants, antibiotics, and hormones; up to 99 percent less environmental impact; and zero pandemic risk. Cultivated meat allows people to have their meat and eat it, too, without affecting the rest of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Medically important antibiotics are being squandered by animal agriculture to compensate for typical factory farming practices.</p>
<p>Cultivating muscle meat directly from cells instead of raising and slaughtering animals would <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1541-4337.12473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce</a> the risk of foodborne illnesses “due to fecal contamination during slaughtering and evisceration of carcasses” because there would be no feces, no slaughter, and no carcasses to eviscerate. In addition, cultivating meat would also reduce the threat from antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30376920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compensate</a> for overcrowded, stressful, and unhygienic conditions on factory farms, animals are typically <a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/2015-Summary-Report-on-Antimicrobials-Sold-or-Distributed-for-Use-in-Food-Producing-Animals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dosed</a> en masse with antibiotics. A lot of antibiotics. About 20 million pounds of medically important antibiotics a year, as you can see here and at 0:57 in my video, <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Human Health Effects of Cultivated Meat: Antibiotic Resistance</a></strong>. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In the United States, for example, farm animals are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/2015-Summary-Report-on-Antimicrobials-Sold-or-Distributed-for-Use-in-Food-Producing-Animals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given</a> about 2 million pounds of penicillin drugs and 15 million pounds of tetracyclines annually. This is madness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Antibiotic drugs important to human medicine go right into the feed and water of animals like cows, pigs, and chickens, by the ton and by the thousands of tons, as shown below and at 1:02 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>. And that <a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/2015-Summary-Report-on-Antimicrobials-Sold-or-Distributed-for-Use-in-Food-Producing-Animals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> all without a prescription.</span></p>

<p>Ninety-seven percent of the tens of millions of pounds of antibiotics given to farm animals in the United States are bought over the counter—without a prescription or even an order from a veterinarian, as seen here and a 1:24. To get even a few milligrams of penicillin, we need a doctor’s prescription, because these are miracle wonder drugs that can’t be squandered. Meanwhile, farmers can just back their trucks up to the feedstore. </p>

<p>Now, half the <em>Salmonella</em> in retail meat—chicken, turkey, beef, and pork—<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/108304/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> resistant to tetracycline, as shown below and at 1:50 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. About a quarter of the bugs <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/108304/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> now resistant to three or more entire classes of antibiotics, including some resistant to “cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone [which] are critically important drugs we use to treat severe <em>Salmonella</em> infections, especially in children.” </p>

<p>Such agricultural applications for antimicrobials are now <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954889" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered</a> an “urgent threat to human health.” “The link between antibiotic use in animals and antibiotic resistance in humans is unequivocal.”</p>
<p>As shown here and at 2:20 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>, it all starts with the poop. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114104" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2-20-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Antibiotic-resistant bugs are selected for and then can spread via meat or produce contaminated by poop or they can <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/antibiotic-feed-fda-documents-IB.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spread</a> through the wind, the air, or the water, or be carried by insects. There are many pathways by which resistant superbugs can escape. So, even if you don’t <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25942290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat</a> meat, you can be “put at risk by the pathogens released from stressed, immunocompromised, contaminant-ﬁlled livestock” dosed with antibiotics. That’s one of the reasons the American Public Health Association <a href="https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/24/11/17/precautionary-moratorium-on-new-concentrated-animal-feed-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> for a moratorium on factory farms, due in part to all the pollution from concentrated animal feed operations (CAFOs) to the surrounding communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Every year, more than ﬁve tons of animal manure are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18033595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produced</a> for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Again, it all <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/25453#:~:text=Antibiotics%20are%20widely%20used%20in,can%20develop%20antibiotic%2Dresistant%20infections." target="_blank" rel="noopener">starts</a> with the poop. But <em>cultivated</em> meat means no guts, no poop, no fecal infections, and no antibiotics necessary. It also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30710599" target="_blank" rel="noopener">means</a> no fecal or antibiotic residues left in “foodstuffs such as milk, egg, and meat” that can potentially cause a variety of side eﬀects beyond just the transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans.</span></p>
<p>And, as you can see here and at 3:30 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>, things are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/2015-Summary-Report-on-Antimicrobials-Sold-or-Distributed-for-Use-in-Food-Producing-Animals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> worse, not better. U.S. animal agriculture is using more antibiotics now than ever.</p>

<p>This isn’t only because more animals are being raised for food, either. Antibiotic sales in the United States are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26241996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outpacing</a> meat production. Yes, meat production is going up, but there is a serious rise in antibiotic sales for meat production, as shown below and at 3:46.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114110" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346.png" alt="" width="1823" height="1032" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346.png 1823w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346-960x543.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346-1024x580.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346-768x435.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346-1536x870.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346-1200x679.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346-720x408.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/06/346-540x306.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1823px) 100vw, 1823px" /></p>
<p>With the combined might of Big Ag and Big Pharma (who profit from selling all the drugs), it’s hard to imagine anything changing on the political side. The only hope may be a change in the production side.</p>
<p>“The unstoppable rise of super-resistant strains of bacteria <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> a serious worldwide problem, resulting in 700 000 deaths every year,” and the projections for global antibiotic use in the production of farm animals <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/18/5554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> “ominous,” estimated to exceed 100,000 tons of antibiotics pumped into animals raised for food by 2030. Quite simply, we <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27454763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may</a> be “on the path to untreatable infections” by using even some of our “last resort antibiotics,” like carbapenems, just to shave a few cents off a pound of meat.</p>
<p>And it’s not just foodborne bacteria. Mad cow disease, swine flu, and bird flu <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3551074/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> the potential to kill millions of people. Skeptical? I’ve got a book for you to read, whose author’s “superb storytelling ability <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1867810/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes</a> every page of the book interesting and fascinating for both specialist and layperson.” (Thanks, <em>Virology Journal</em>, for the wonderful book review and calling my book “a must read.”)</p>
<p>Given the threat of the chickens <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17666704/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming</a> home to roost, an editorial in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em> thought that “it is curious, therefore, that changing the way humans treat animals—most basically, ceasing to eat them or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten—is largely off the radar as a significant preventative measure. Such a change, if sufficiently adopted or imposed, could still reduce the chances of the much-feared influenza epidemic…Yet humanity does not consider this option.”</p>
<p>That may be moot, though, because we could cultivate all the chicken we want, without guts or lungs.</p>
<p>It’s hard to stress the importance of that <em>American Journal of Public Health</em> editorial. As devastating as COVID-19 has been, it may just be a dress rehearsal for an even greater threat waiting in the wings—the wings of chickens.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading candidate for the next pandemic is a bird flu virus known as H7N9, which is a hundred times deadlier than COVID-19. Instead of 1 in 250 patients dying, H7N9 has killed 40 percent of the people it infects.</p>
<p>The last time a bird flu virus jumped directly to humans and caused a pandemic, it triggered the deadliest plague in human history—the 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million people. That had a 2 percent death rate. What if we had a pandemic infecting billions where death was closer to a flip of a coin?</p>
<p>The good news is that there is something we can do about it. Just as eliminating the exotic animal trade and live animal markets may go a long way toward preventing the next coronavirus pandemic, reforming the way we raise domestic animals for food may help forestall the next killer flu. The bottom line is that it’s not worth risking the lives of millions of people for the sake of cheaper chicken.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Please tell us a little bit about yourself and your work.  </b></p>
<p>I am a vegan cookbook author and health and wellness content creator. I started Veggiekins blog while I was in college as a means for sharing recipes and spreading the vegan lifestyle, and it has since turned into my full-time job, which has been absolutely incredible. I&#8217;m also the founder of a matcha brand, Frauth. Outside of work, I split my time between New York and Los Angeles, and you can usually find me at a farmers market!<b></b></p>
<p><b>In your experience, how have you found food to tell a story and shape culture? </b></p>
<p>I think that when you come from any type of culture, food is so important because it&#8217;s one way culture is passed down from generation to generation. I think that&#8217;s why sharing recipes and passing them down is so crucial for preserving culture. In my Asian cultures––Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese––I think food is really important because it&#8217;s also how we communicate with each other and share love. In our cultures, it&#8217;s not quite as common to express verbally that you love someone. We really don&#8217;t talk too much about feelings, but we always gather around the table to share a meal as a family and many of our holidays and family gatherings revolve around food. There&#8217;s a joke that your Asian parents might not apologize or say they love you, but they will always put food on the table for you or cut up a fruit plate for you to communicate that. So, with that in mind, I think that food is a pivotal part of Asian culture. For me personally, a lot of my memories from childhood revolve around a specific meal or have a specific dish tied to it. Food evokes a lot of really powerful memories, and I think it&#8217;s a really great vehicle for storytelling in that way. <b></b></p>
<p><b>How do you educate people about the intersection of food, health, community, and culture?</b></p>
<p>When it comes to most Asian cuisines, there really isn’t very much dairy, which I think is incredible. It also makes them such great foundations for lots of vegan-friendly options. As well, in my three cultures, there are different types of existing plant-based diets followed by religious groups, for example. I think there is a lot to explore, and the same can be said about most cultures. For example, in Korea, there are monks who eat temple food, which is primarily-plant based; in Japan, the Shojin cuisine is also primarily plant-based; and in China, a lot of Buddhists don&#8217;t eat any meat or animal products at all. Additionally, my grandparents always told me that, when they were younger, they primarily ate plant-based––mostly grains and vegetables––because meat and animal products were so expensive and reserved more for the higher classes in society. Nowadays, I think people associate meat with Asian cuisine (e.g., Korean BBQ), though, in reality, a lot of Asian cuisine historically revolved around grains and plants.<b></b></p>
<p><b>What are some plant-based ingredients and vegan dishes you would like to highlight as traditional to your cultures and/or other Asian cultures? What are your favorites to cook with?</b></p>
<p>A plant-based ingredient that I think is essential to Asian culture is tofu, of course! No Asian person is unfamiliar with tofu, and I think that&#8217;s incredible because it&#8217;s such a great source of plant protein. Rice and other grains are also commonly used throughout Asian cuisines, and some of my personal favourites include tempeh and some of the more unique Asian veggies you wouldn&#8217;t typically find at a conventional grocery store (e.g., bean sprouts, bok choy, morning glory, and pea shoots). There&#8217;s a great diversity of veggies to choose from in Asian cuisine.</p>
<p><b>As a plant-based chef, what do you envision as the way forward to encourage people to include more fruits and vegetables into their diets? </b></p>
<p>One of the things I like to stress the most is that vegetables can be treated with as much care, if not more care, than meat and other animal products. I think a lot of people put in the minimum effort when preparing veggies or may even just eat them raw. When we marinate, smoke, sous vide, roast, or slow cook them, the result is so different. </p>
<p>Nowadays, people have developed this hunger for more global cuisines and are more interested in trying dishes from other cultures, which is a great way to encourage individuals to incorporate more fruits and veggies into their diets. When you start to explore beyond just the United States, for instance, and see what the world has to offer, you find that there are so many different types of fruits and vegetables that you can enjoy. Additionally, there are so many more flavor profiles and spice blends to work with to season your vegetables. Keeping it interesting for the palate is so important! <b></b></p>
<p><b>What significance does AAPI Month have for you, and how do you celebrate your heritage? </b></p>
<p>AAPI month means a lot to me because I&#8217;m not just Asian, but Asian American. I was born in the United States to parents who had already immigrated here and speak primarily English in the house. I don&#8217;t feel 100% Asian and, of course, don&#8217;t feel 100% American either, so I think that the distinction is really nuanced and makes me feel seen. It&#8217;s an incredible sign that people are really embracing others and diversity, which is so important. It&#8217;s helped to introduce other cultures to other people and encourage curiosity and hunger for knowledge about others.</p>
<p>I really celebrate my heritage through food and sharing recipes that feel are authentic to my culture and my Asian-American family. It&#8217;s such a treat to be able to share that with others and especially to do that plant-based!</p>
<p><b>Please tell us a little bit about your cookbook, </b><b><i>Sesame, Soy, Spice</i></b><b><em>, </em>and what inspired you to write it.</b></p>
<p>My cookbook was really inspired by my family and my upbringing. “Asian American” is truly the best way to describe my family and the food we eat because we are Asian (and three types of Asian at that), but we are also very much American. Growing up, the food on our table looked like a combination of both western and American foods, as well as the Asian dishes I grew up eating. For example, one thing I love is popcorn, but with Japanese furikake seasoning on top. Sometimes we might sub out chili paste or hot sauce with gochujang, a Korean fermented red pepper paste.</p>
<p>Throughout my cookbook, I really wanted to emphasize that eating vegan does not mean you have to give up your culture and that it can actually be so much fun reconnecting with your culture through trying to recreate those favorite recipes as vegan. It not only makes living a vegan lifestyle more exciting and inclusive, but also more sustainable because there&#8217;s more variety in the foods you eat. When I first became vegan, I thought I could only eat foods like salad bowls, grain bowls, and smoothie bowls. Then I realized that it&#8217;s not really a diet but a way of life and that almost any cuisine can be vegan-friendly if you get creative in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Through the short stories in my cookbook, I also document my journey to becoming vegan and making peace with my relationship with food. I share the story of how becoming vegan taught me compassion and aided in that journey. The process of writing the cookbook was very meaningful to my family because we really got to connect more than ever through food. I would chat with them about recipes from childhood that I wanted to try to recreate, and we would speak on the phone while we were both in the kitchen, trying to work out a recipe. It was a very nostalgic time for me because, often, we&#8217;d end up reminiscing about memories from my childhood while cooking.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What are the direct health implications of making clean meat—that is, meat without animals? In a 1932 article in Popular Mechanics entitled “Fifty Years Hence,” [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are the direct health implications of making clean meat—that is, meat without animals?</p>
<p>In a 1932 article in <em>Popular Mechanics</em> <a href="http://rolandanderson.se/Winston_Churchill/Fifty_Years_Hence.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entitled</a> “Fifty Years Hence,” Winston Churchill predicted that we would one day “escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium.” Indeed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21682287" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing</a> meat straight from muscle cells could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 96 percent, lower water usage by as much as 96 percent, and lower land usage by 99 percent.</p>
<p>If we are to <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/changing-climate-changing-diets-pathways-to-lower-meat-consumption/oclc/951432327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid</a> dangerous climate change by the middle of the century, global meat consumption simply cannot continue to rise at the current rate. And there have certainly <a href="http://eprints.glos.ac.uk/3794/1/Less%20Meat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been</a> initiatives like Meatless Mondays to try to get people to cut down, but so far, “they do not appear to be contributing in any significant way to the translation of the idea of eating less meat into the mainstream.” So, “in the light of people’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28207878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued</a> desire to eat meat, it seems the problems associated with consumption are unlikely to be fully resolved by attitude change. Instead, they must be addressed from an alternate perspective: changing the product.”</p>
<p>From an environmental standpoint, it seems like a slam dunk. From an animal welfare standpoint, it could get rid of factory farms and slaughter plants for good, and I wouldn’t have to stumble across articles like this in the scientific literature: “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25923725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discerning</a> Pig Screams in Production Environments.” I mean, what more do we need to know about modern animal agriculture than the fact that, “in recent years, a number of so-called…‘ag-gag’ laws have been <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17524032.2014.968178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> and passed…across the USA,” banning undercover photographing or videotaping inside such operations to keep us all in the dark.</p>
<p>What about the human health implications of cultivated meat? I <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29684844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> the animal welfare, environment, and food security benefits, but what about “the potential for cultured meat to have health/safety beneﬁts to individual consumers”? Nutritionally, the most important advantage is being able to <a href="https://academicjournals.org/article/article1379932849_Bhat%20and%20Bhat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swap</a> out the type the fat. Right now, producers are growing straight muscle tissue, so it could be marbled with something less harmful than animal fat, though, of course, there’s still animal protein.</p>
<p>When it comes to health, the biggest, clearest advantage <a href="https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/cultured-meat-the-systemic-implications-of-an-emerging-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> food safety, reducing the risk of foodborne pathogens. There <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25942290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has</a> been a sixfold increase in food poisoning over the last few decades, with tens of millions “sickened annually by infected food in the United States alone,” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20226968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including</a> hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of annual deaths. Contaminated meats and other animal products <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25942290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> the most common cause.</p>
<p>When the cultivated meat industry <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/clean-meat-how-growing-meat-without-animals-will-revolutionize-dinner-and-the-world/oclc/1038567806" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls</a> its products clean meat, that’s not just a nod to clean energy. Food-poisoning pathogens like <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, and <em>Salmonella</em> are fecal bacteria. They are a result of fecal contamination. They’re intestinal bugs, so we don’t have to worry about them if we’re making meat without the intestines.</p>
<p>Yes, there are all sorts of “methods to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25364917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remove</a> visible fecal contamination” in slaughter plants these days and even experimental imaging technologies <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed</a> to detect more “diluted fecal contaminations,” but we <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/92769/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> still left at the retail level with about 10 percent of chicken contaminated with <em>Salmonella</em> and 40 percent of retail chicken contaminated with <em>Campylobacter</em>. What’s more, most poultry and about half of retail ground beef and pork chops are contaminated with <em>E. coli</em>, an indicator of fecal residue, as shown here and at 3:47 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-human-health-effects-of-cultivated-meat-food-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Human Health Effects of Cultivated Meat: Food Safety</a></strong>. We don’t have to cook the crap out of cultivated meat, though, because there isn’t any crap to begin with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why is the incidence of side effects from statins so low in clinical trials while appearing to be so high in the real world?</p>
<p>“There is now overwhelming evidence to support <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30653440/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reducing</a> LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)”—so-called bad cholesterol—to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD),” the number one killer of men and women. So, why <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25189302/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> adherence to cholesterol-lowering statin drug therapy such “a major challenge worldwide”? Researchers found “that the majority of studies <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30653537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that at least 40%, and as much as 80%, of patients did not comply fully with statin treatment recommendations.” Three-quarters of patients may flat out stop taking them, and almost 90 percent may discontinue treatment altogether.</p>
<p>When asked why they <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24079289/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped</a> taking the pills, most “former statin users or discontinuers…cited muscle pain, a side effect, as the primary reason&#8230;” “SAMSs”—statin-associated muscle symptoms—“<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30653440/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> by far the most prevalent and important adverse event, with up to 72% of all statin adverse events being muscle-related.” <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30032220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taking</a> coenzyme Q10 supplements as a treatment for statin-associated muscle symptoms was a good idea in theory, but they <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t</a> appear to help. Normally, side-effect symptoms <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23492461" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go</a> away when you stop the drug but can sometimes linger for a year or more. There <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29706391/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> “growing evidence that statin intolerance is predominantly psychosocial, not pharmacological.” Really? It may be mostly just in people’s heads?</p>
<p>“Statins have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed</a> a bad reputation with the public, a phenomenon driven largely by proliferation on the Internet of bizarre and unscientific but seemingly persuasive criticism of these drugs.” “Does <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29706390/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Googling</a> lead to statin intolerance?” But people have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30653537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped</a> taking statins for decades before there even was an Internet. What kinds of data have doctors suggested that patients are falsely “misattribut[ing] normal aches and pains to be statin side effects”?</p>
<p>Well, if you take people who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24737272/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> to have statin-related muscle pain and randomize them back and forth between statins and an identical-looking placebo in three-week blocks, they can’t tell whether they’re getting the real drug or the sugar pill. The problem with that study, though, is that it may <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25285547/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take</a> months not only to develop statin-induced muscle pain, but months before it goes away, so no wonder three weeks on and three weeks off may not be long enough for the participants to discern which is which.</p>
<p>However, these data <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28476288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> more convincing: Ten thousand people were randomized to a statin or a sugar pill for a few years, but so many more people were dying in the sugar pill group that the study had to be stopped prematurely. So then everyone was offered the statin, and the researchers noted that there was “no excess of reports of muscle-related AEs” (adverse effects) among patients assigned to the statin over those assigned to the placebo. But when the placebo phase was over and the people knew they were on a statin, they went on to report more muscle side effects than those who knew they weren’t taking the statin. “These analyses illustrate the so-called nocebo effect,” which is akin to the opposite of the placebo effect.</p>
<p>Placebo effects are positive consequences falsely attributed to a treatment, whereas nocebo effects are negative consequences falsely attributed to a treatment, as was evidently seen here. There was an excess rate of muscle-related adverse effects reported only when patients and their doctors were aware that statin therapy was being used, and not when its use was concealed. The researchers hope “these results will help assure both physicians and patients that most AEs associated with statins are not causally related to use of the drug and should help counter…exaggerated claims about statin-related side effects.”</p>
<p>These <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27616593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> the kinds of results from “placebo-controlled randomised trials [that] have shown deﬁnitively that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (ie, they represent misattribution.)” Now, “only a few patients will <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31070941/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe</a> that their SAMS are of psychogenic origin” and just in their head, but their denial <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may</a> have “deadly consequences.” Indeed, “discontinuing statin treatment may be a life-threatening mistake.”</p>
<p>Below and at 4:46 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-common-are-muscle-side-effects-from-statins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Common Are Muscle Side Effects from Statins?</a></strong>, you can see the mortality of those who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738423/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped</a> their statins after having a possible adverse reaction compared to those who stuck with them. This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translates</a> into about “1 excess death for every 83 patients who discontinued treatment” within a four-year period. So, when there <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28744105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> media reports about statin side effects and people stop taking them, this <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28476288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could</a> “result in thousands of fatal and disabling heart attacks and strokes, which would otherwise have been avoided. Seldom in the history of modern therapeutics have the substantial proven benefits of a treatment been compromised to such an extent by serious misrepresentations of the evidence for its safety.” But is it a misrepresentation to suggest “that statin therapy causes side-effects in up to one fifth of patients”? That <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24952854/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> what is seen in clinical practice; between 10 to 25 percent of patients placed on statins complain of muscle problems. However, because we don’t see anywhere near those kinds of numbers in controlled trials, patients are accused of being confused. Why <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24920685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> the incidence of side effects from statins so low in clinical trials while appearing to be so high in the real world? </p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22607822/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take</a> this meta-analysis of clinical trials, for example: It found muscle problems not in 1 in 5 patients, but only 1 in 2,000. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22607823/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Should</a> everyone over a certain age be on statins? Not surprisingly, every one of those trials was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24149819/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded</a> by statin manufacturers themselves. So, for example, “how <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27838726/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could</a> the statin RCTs [randomized controlled trials] miss detecting mild statin-related muscle adverse side effects such as myalgia [muscle pain]? By not asking. A review of 44 statin RCTs reveals that only 1 directly asked about muscle-related adverse effects.” So, are the vast majority of side effects just being missed in all these trials, or are the vast majority of side effects seen in clinical practice just a figment of patients’ imagination? The bottom line is we don’t know, but there is certainly an urgent need to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24920685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figure</a> it out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switching to a plant-based diet has been shown to achieve far better outcomes than those reported on conventional treatments for both active and quiescent stages of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis.</p>
<p>Important to our understanding and the prevention of the global increase of inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27793607/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> that “dietary ﬁber reduces risk, whereas dietary fat, animal protein, and sugar increase it.” “Despite the recognition of westernization of lifestyle as a major driver of the growing incidence of IBD, no countermeasures against such lifestyle changes have been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30005726/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended</a>, except that patients with Crohn&#8217;s disease should not smoke.”</p>
<p>We know that “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29035175/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consuming</a> whole, plant-based foods is synonymous with an anti-inflammatory diet.” Lists of foods with inflammatory effects and anti-inflammatory effects are shown here and at 0:50 in my video, <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-diet-for-crohns-disease-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Diet for Crohn’s Disease</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113527" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-50-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>How about putting a plant-based diet to the test?</p>
<p>Cutting down on red and processed meats <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30872105/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t</a> work, but what about cutting down on all meat? A 25-year-old man “with newly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31226766/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagnosed</a> CD…failed to enter clinical remission despite standard medical therapy. After switching to a diet based exclusively on grains, legumes [beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils], vegetables, and fruits, he entered clinical remission without need for medication and showed no signs of CD on follow-up colonoscopy.”</p>
<p>It’s worth delving into some of the details. The conventional treatment he was started on is inﬂiximab, sold as REMICADE®, which can <a href="https://www.remicade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause</a> a stroke and may increase our chances of getting lymphoma or other cancers. (It also <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696998.2019.1609481#supplemental-material-section" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs</a> $35,000 a year.) It may not even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2011.05.027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work</a> in 35 to 40 percent of patients, and that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31226766/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed</a> to be the case with the 25-year-old man. So, his dose was increased after 37 weeks, but he was still suffering after two years on the drug. Then he completely eliminated animal products and processed foods from his diet and finally experienced a complete resolution of his symptoms.</p>
<p>“Prior to this, his diet had been the typical American diet, consisting of meat, dairy products, refined grains, processed foods, and modest amounts of vegetables and fruits. Having experienced complete clinical remission for the first time since his Crohn’s disease diagnosis, the patient decided to switch to a whole food, plant-based diet permanently, severely reducing his intake of processed foods and limiting animal products to one serving, or less, per week.” Whenever his diet slipped, his symptoms started coming back, but he could always eliminate them by eating healthier again. After six months adhering to these diet and lifestyle changes, including stress relief and exercise, a follow-up “demonstrated complete mucosal healing [of the gut lining] with no visible evidence of Crohn’s disease.”</p>
<p>We know that “a diet consisting of whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables has been shown to be helpful in the prevention and treatment of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, gallbladder disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and many cancers. Although further research is required, this case report suggests that Crohn’s disease might be added to this list of conditions.” That further research <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20503448/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has</a> already been done! About 20 patients with Crohn’s disease were placed on a semi-vegetarian diet—no more than half a serving of fish once a week and half a serving of meat once every two weeks—and they achieved a 100 percent remission rate at one year and 90 percent at two years.</p>
<p>Some strayed from the diet, though. What happened to them? As you can see below and at 3:32 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-diet-for-crohns-disease-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>, after one year, half had <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20503448/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relapsed</a>, and, at year two, only 20 percent had remained in remission. But those who stuck with the semi-veg diet had remarkable success. It was a small study with no formal control group, but it represents the best-reported result in Crohn’s relapse prevention published in the medical literature to date. </p>

<p>Nowadays, Crohn’s patients are often <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29035182/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treated</a> with so-called biologic drugs, expensive injected antibodies that suppress the immune system. They have effectively induced and maintained remission in Crohn’s disease, but not in everybody. The current remission rate in Crohn&#8217;s with early use of REMICADE® is 64 percent. So, 30 to 40 percent of patients “are likely to experience a disabling disease course even after their first treatment.” What about adding a plant-based diet? Remission rates jumped up to 100 percent for those who didn’t have to drop out due to drug side effects. Even after excluding milder cases, researchers found that 100 percent of those with serious, even “severe/fulminant disease, achieved remission.”</p>
<p>If we look at gold standard systematic reviews, they <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30736095/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conclude</a> that the effects of dietary interventions on inflammatory bowel diseases—Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis—are uncertain. However, this is because only randomized controlled trials were considered. That’s totally understandable, as that is the most rigorous study design. “Nevertheless, people with IBD <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deserve</a> advice based on the ‘best available evidence’ rather than no advice at all&#8230;” And switching to a plant-based diet has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624192/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> to achieve “far better outcomes” than those reported on conventional treatments in both active and quiescent stages in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. For example, below and at 5:37 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-diet-for-crohns-disease-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, you can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30881895/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see</a> one-year remission rates in Crohn’s disease (100 percent) compared to budesonide, an immunosuppressant corticosteroid drug (30 to 40 percent), a half elemental diet, such as at-home tube feedings (64 percent), the $35,000-a-year drug REMICADE® (46 percent), or the $75,000-a-year drug Humira (57 percent). </p>

<p>Safer, cheaper, and more effective. That’s why some researchers have made the “recommendation of plant-based diets for inflammatory bowel disease.”</p>
<p>It would seem clear that treatment based on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624192/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressing</a> the cause of the disease is optimal. Spreading the word about healthier diets could help halt the scourge of inflammatory bowel disease, but how will people hear about this amazing research without some kind of public education campaign? That’s what NutritionFacts.org is all about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Plant-based diets can be 98 percent effective in keeping ulcerative colitis patients in remission, far exceeding the efficacy of other treatments.</p>
<p>“One of the most common questions physicians treating patients with IBD [inflammatory bowel disease] are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15361484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> is whether changing diet could positively affect the course of their disease.” Traditionally, we had to respond that we didn’t know. That may now be changing, given the “evidence in the literature that hydrogen sulfide may play a role in UC,” ulcerative colitis. And, since the sulfur-containing amino acids concentrated in meat cause an increase in colonic levels of this rotten egg gas, perhaps we should “take off the meat.” Indeed, animal protein isn’t <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22055893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated</a> only with an increased risk of getting inﬂammatory bowel disease in the first place, but also IBD relapses once you have the disease.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27768566/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> a recent development. “Because the concept of IBD as a lifestyle disease mediated mainly by a westernized diet is not widely appreciated, an analysis of diet in the follow-up period [after diagnosis] in relation to a relapse of IBD has been ignored”—but no longer. Ulcerative colitis patients in remission and their diets were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15361498/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed</a> for a year to see which foods were linked to the return of their bloody diarrhea. Researchers found that the “strongest relationship between a dietary factor and an increased risk of relapse observed in this study was for a high intake of meat,” as I discuss in my video <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-diet-for-ulcerative-colitis-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Best Diet for Ulcerative Colitis Treatment</strong></a>.</p>
<p>What if people <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10326542/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower</a> their intake of sulfur-containing amino acids by decreasing their consumption of animal products? Researchers tried this on four ulcerative colitis patients, and without any change in their medications, the patients experienced about a fourfold improvement in their loose stools. In fact, they felt so much better that the researchers didn’t think it was ethical to try switching the patients back to their typical diets. “Sulfur-containing amino acids <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31027194/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> the primary source of dietary sulfur,” so a “low-sulfur” diet essentially means “a shift from a more traditional western diet (high in animal protein and fat, and low in ﬁber) to more of a plant-based diet (high in fiber, lower in animal protein and fat).” “Altogether, westernized diets <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30881895/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> pro-inflammatory, and PBD [plant-based diets] are anti-inflammatory.”</p>
<p>What <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26824967/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can</a> treatment with a plant-based diet do after the onset of ulcerative colitis during a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet? A 36-year-old man lost 13 pounds on a low-carb diet, but he also lost his health; he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. When he was put on a diet centered around whole plant foods, his symptoms resolved without medication. He achieved remission. That was just one case, though. Case reports are akin to glorified anecdotes. The value of case reports lies in their ability to inspire researchers to put them to the test, and that’s exactly what they did.</p>
<p>Until then, there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30005726/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had</a> never been a study published that focused on using plant-based diets for treating ulcerative colitis. Wrote the researchers, a group of Japanese gastroenterologists, “We consider that the lack of a suitable diet is the biggest issue faced in the current treatment of IBD. We regard IBD as a lifestyle disease caused mainly by our omnivorous (Western) diet. We have been providing a plant-based diet (PBD) to all patients with IBD” for more than a decade and have published extraordinary results, far better than have been reported elsewhere in the medical literature to date. (I profiled some of their early work in one of the first videos that went up on NutritionFacts.org.) The researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30881895/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a plant-based diet to be “effective in the maintenance of remission” in Crohn’s disease by 100 percent at one year and 90 percent at two years. What about a plant-based diet for relapse prevention in ulcerative colitis?</p>
<p>“Educational hospitalization” <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30005726/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved</a> bringing patients into the hospital to control their diet and educate them about the benefits of plant-based eating (so they’d be more motivated to continue it at home). “Most patients (77%) experienced some improvement, such as disappearance or decrease of bloody stool during hospitalization.” Fantastic!</p>
<p>Here’s the really exciting part. The researchers then followed the patients for five years, and 81 percent of them remained in remission for the entire five years, and 98 percent kept the disease at bay for at least one year. That blows away other treatments. Those relapse rates are far lower than those reported with medication. Under conventional treatment, other studies found that about half of the individuals relapse, compared to only 2 percent of those taught to eat healthier.</p>
<p>“A PBD was previously shown to be effective in both the active and quiescent stages of Crohn&#8217;s disease. The current study showed that a PBD is effective in both the active and quiescent stages of UC as well.” So, the researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31050638/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did</a> another study on even more severely affected cases with active disease and found the same results, with plant-based eating beating conventional drug therapy by far. People felt so much better that they were still eating more plant-based food even six years later. The researchers conclude that a plant-based diet is effective for treating ulcerative colitis to prevent a relapse.</p>
<p>Why? Well, plant-based diets <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30005726/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> rich in fiber, which feeds our good gut bugs. “This observation might partly explain why a PBD prevents a variety of chronic diseases. Indeed, the same explanation applies to IBD, indicating that replacing an omnivorous diet with a PBD in IBD is the right approach.” <br />
 <br />
It’s like using plant-based diets to treat the cause of heart disease, our number one killer. Plant-based eating isn’t only safer and cheaper, but it also works better with no noted adverse side effects. Let’s compare that to the laundry list of side effects of immunosuppressants <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cyclosporine-oral-route/description/drg-20075815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> for ulcerative colitis, like cyclosporine, which you can see below and at 5:40 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-diet-for-ulcerative-colitis-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. </p>

<p>We now have even fancier drugs <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31012362/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costing</a> about $60,000 a year, about $5,000 a month, and they don’t even <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31553842/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work</a> very well; clinical remission at one year is only about 17 to 34 percent. And, instead of no adverse side effects, the drugs <a href="https://www.remicade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can</a> give us a stroke, <a href="https://www.simponi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give</a> us heart failure, and can even <a href="https://www.humira.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give</a> us cancer, including a rare type of cancer that often results in death. Also, a serious brain disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which can <a href="https://www.entyvio.com/vedolizumab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kill</a> us, and for which there is no known treatment or cure. One drug lists an “increased risk of death” but touts that it’s just “a small pill” in an “easy-to-open bottle.” I’d skip the pills (and their potential side effects) and stick with plant-based eating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eating a diet filled with animal products can disrupt our microbiome faster than taking an antibiotic.</p>
<p>If you search online for “Crohn’s disease and diet” or “ulcerative colitis and diet,” the top results <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24107394/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> a hodgepodge of conflicting advice, as you can see below and at 0:15 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-inflammatory-bowel-disease-with-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preventing Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Diet</a></strong>. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113487" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-15-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>What does science say? A systematic review of the medical literature on dietary intake and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21468064/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finds</a> that Crohn’s disease is associated with the intake of fat and meat, whereas dietary fiber and fruits appear protective. The same associations are seen with ulcerative colitis, the other major inflammatory bowel disease—namely, increased risk with fat and meat, and a protective association with vegetable intake. </p>
<p>Why, according to this meta-analysis of nine separate studies, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26575042/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do</a> meat consumers have about a 50 percent greater risk for inflammatory bowel disease? One possibility is that meat <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22055893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may</a> be a vehicle for bacteria that play a role in the development of such diseases. For instance, meat contains “huge amounts of <em>Yersinia</em>.” It’s possible that antibiotic residues in the meat itself could be theoretically mucking with our microbiome, but <em>Yersinia</em> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14683664/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> so-called psychotropic bacteria, meaning they’re able to grow at refrigerator temperatures, and they’ve been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15967332/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> to be significantly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This supports the concept that <em>Yersinia</em> infection may be a trigger of chronic IBD.</p>
<p>Animal protein is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2010.192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated</a> with triple the risk of inflammatory bowel disease, but plant protein is not, as you can see below and at 1:39 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-inflammatory-bowel-disease-with-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a>. Why? One reason is that animal protein can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2010.192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead</a> to the formation of toxic bacterial end products, such as hydrogen sulfide, the rotten egg gas. Hydrogen sulfide is not just “one of the main malodorous compounds in human flatus”; it is a “poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis.” So, if you <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go</a> on a meat-heavy, low-carb diet, we aren’t talking just about some “malodorous rectal ﬂatus,” but increased risk of irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel syndrome (ulcerative colitis), and eventually, colorectal cancer. </p>

<p>Specific bacteria, like <em>Biophilia wadsworthia</em>, can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24336217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take</a> this sulfur that ends up in our colon and produce hydrogen sulfide. Eating a diet based on animal products, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25665875/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packed</a> with meat, eggs, and dairy, can specifically increase the growth of this bacteria. People underestimate the dramatic effect diet can have on our gut bacteria. As shown below and at 3:12 in my <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-inflammatory-bowel-disease-with-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>video</strong></a>, when people are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25665875/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given</a> a fecal transplant, it can take three days for their microbiome to shift. Take a powerful antibiotic like Cipro, and it can take a week. But if we start eating a diet heavy in meat and eggs, within a single day, our microbiome can change—and not for the better. The bad bacterial machinery that churns out hydrogen sulfide can more than double, and this is consistent with the thinking that “diet-induced changes to the gut microbiota [flora] may contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease.” In other words, the increase in sulfur compounds in the colon when we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9274475/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat</a> meat “is not only of interest in the field of flatology”—the study of human farts—“but may also be of importance in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis…” </p>

					<description><![CDATA[What are the three sources of liver fat in fatty liver disease, and how can we get rid of it? Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are the three sources of liver fat in fatty liver disease, and how can we get rid of it?</p>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262589/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> now the most frequent chronic liver disease, thanks in part to our epidemic of obesity, and is even <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28954437/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seen</a> in children. “[N]early 70–80% of obese children may have NAFLD.” Why do we care? Because a fatty liver can progress into fatty hepatitis, which can cause scarring and liver cirrhosis, and cirrhosis is bad enough, but it may also cause the development of liver cancer.</p>
<p>What is the source of the liver fat in fatty liver disease? There <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> three main sources: the excess sugar in our diet, the excess fat in our diet, and the fat spilling over from our excess body fat, as you can see at 0:51 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-the-best-diet-for-fatty-liver-disease-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Diet for Fatty Liver Disease Treatment</a></strong>. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113443" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/05/0-51-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>How do we know excess dietary sugar <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> bad? Because it’s been put to the test. When teens with fatty liver disease were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30667502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randomized</a> to a diet low in free sugars (meaning a diet low in added sugar and sugary beverages), they experienced a significant improvement within eight weeks. Given these new data, a liver journal editorial <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31446629/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read</a> that “a strong argument can be made that we are beyond any period of uncertainty about the harmful effects of excess sugar consumption and that we must now act on the large body of available data to inform the public of the health risks of eating too much sugar.”</p>
<p>And how do we know excess dietary fat <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> bad? Because it’s also been put to the test. When people were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15741262/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randomized</a> to a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet with the same number of calories, within just two weeks, the liver fat of those on the low-fat diet decreased by 20 percent, whereas it increased by 35 percent in the participants getting the same number of calories but on a high-fat diet.</p>
<p>On the low-fat diet, insulin levels went down about 15 percent, and on the high-fat diet, insulin levels went up about 15 percent. Low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diet advocates often talk about how we need to eat more fat and less carbs to keep our insulin levels down, but the exact opposite happens when it’s actually put to the test. A single high-fat meal not only <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28112681/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases</a> liver fat but also insulin resistance. Within four hours, our whole-body insulin sensitivity can drop by 25 percent, so our body has to pump out that much more insulin. As the accompanying editorial put it: “A single fat bolus [dose] <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28112684/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packs</a> a punch.”</p>
<p>So, to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30968561/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help</a> prevent or treat fatty liver disease, patients should limit or avoid eating foods rich in fats. While more long-term clinical trials are always <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needed</a>, “based on current evidence, we would recommend a diet low in fat, notably in saturated fatty acids, and low in refined carbohydrates, notably by reducing soft drinks consumption…as these nutritional factors may play a pivotal role in NAFLD.” So that means a diet low in meat, dairy, junk, and reﬁned carbs, especially soda. Saturated fat <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29844096/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> not only “more metabolically harmful for the human liver than unsaturated fat,” but saturated fat is more harmful than straight sugar. What happened when study participants were overfed with 1,000 calories of saturated fat (like cheese and coconut oil), unsaturated fat (like nuts and olive oil), or sugar (like soda and candy)? Overeating 1,000 calories a day of anything isn’t good for us, but the saturated fat increased liver fat by 55 percent, significantly more than the unsaturated fats, with the candy coming in between the two.</p>
<p>So, “although weight loss is beneficial in NAFLD, certain diets known to induce weight loss can actually <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause</a> or exacerbate this disease, and therefore induce insulin resistance, such as very low carbohydrate, high fat diets.” In contrast, “healthy plant-based diets are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30578029/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated</a> with lower NAFLD risk and more favorable liver function tests profile.” The consumption of legumes (beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils), for example, is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30796701/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated</a> with a lower risk of fatty liver, up to 65 percent lower odds from eating more beans.</p>
<p>In the earlier study, researchers weren’t <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30578029/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking</a> at people eating strictly plant-based diets, just more or less so. It’s harder to study those eating completely meat-free diets since they currently represent just a small segment of the U.S. population. But what about Americans of Indian descent? South Asians, individuals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30418560/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originating</a> from the Indian subcontinent, are “one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States,” and they appear to largely retain their diets, with about the same percentage of vegetarians as in India—nearly 40 percent. We know that in India, meat eaters <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26900270/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> at significantly higher risk of fatty liver disease. It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29875591/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> the same in Taiwan, with vegetarians at significantly lower risk of fatty liver. And even the vegetarians who were affected had significantly less liver scarring, as you can see below and at 4:35 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-the-best-diet-for-fatty-liver-disease-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. Their data <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29875591/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> that “replacing a serving of soy with a serving of meat or fish was associated with 12%-13 % increased risk”—having a single serving of meat instead of soy elevates the risk of fatty liver. </p>

<p>And in the United States? Eating a vegetarian diet was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30418560/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated</a> with being slimmer and having better blood sugars, better cholesterol, and less than half the odds of fatty liver disease. Is it cause and effect? We have to put it to the test. In an effort to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31560040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse</a> a fatty liver patient’s inflammatory bowel disease with a plant-based diet, researchers found that their liver inflammation was dramatically improved, but they also lost about nine pounds in the first 11 days, thanks to eating healthfully, so it’s hard to tease out the specific effects of the diet on its own. In fact, we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30968561/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> to be careful about rapid weight loss, because all that extra fat being broken down can flood into the bloodstream and sometimes make things worse. So, for individuals with fatty liver disease, losing about three pounds a week might be safer.</p>
<p>Even though a plant-based diet has yet to be properly put to the test in a randomized clinical trial for fatty liver disease, I would submit that it is still the best diet for this disease, and that isn’t <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31560040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based</a> on a single case report, but on the fact that cardiovascular disease, not liver failure, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28052624/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> the most common cause of death among patients with fatty liver disease. And we do have randomized controlled trials <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9863851/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proving</a> that a healthy plant-based diet and lifestyle programs can reverse heart disease and open up arteries without drugs, surgery, or stents. Yes, patients with fatty liver disease and fatty hepatitis “may eventually <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28052624/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">develop</a> cirrhosis [of the liver], but only if they do not die of cardiovascular diseases first.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States in January 2025 alone, approximately </span><a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 million commercially-raised birds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mostly egg-laying hens, were affected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1). These numbers are staggering yet barely scratch the surface of a potentially larger threat looming over the country. If action is not taken now, the next pandemic could be far deadlier than the 1918 influenza and COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>What Was the 1918 Influenza?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “The </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7843353/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1918 influenza pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed more people in less time than any other disease before or since”; it was the “</span><a href="https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB114/B114_6-en.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most deadly disease event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the history of humanity.” Indeed, it </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15668219/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed more people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a single year than the bubonic plague—the “black death”—in the Middle Ages killed in a century. The 1918 virus also killed more people in twenty-five weeks </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15543821/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than AIDS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed in twenty-five years. According to one academic reviewer, this “single, brief epidemic generated more fatalities, more suffering, and more demographic change in the United States </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4780385_Howard_Phillips_and_David_Killingray_eds_The_Spanish_Influenza_Pandemic_of_1918-19_New_Perspectives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than all the wars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Twentieth Century.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>What Caused the 1918 Flu Pandemic?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the human influenza virus wasn’t even discovered until 1933, an inspector with the U.S. Bureau of Animal Industry had been publishing research as early as 1919 that suggested a role for farm animals in the pandemic. Inspector J.S. Koen of Fort Dodge, Iowa, </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Am%20J%20Vet%20Med&amp;title=A%20practical%20method%20for%20field%20diagnosis%20of%20swine%20disease&amp;author=J.S.%20Koen&amp;volume=14&amp;publication_year=1919&amp;pages=468-470&amp;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The similarity of the epidemic among people and the epidemic among pigs was so close, the reports so frequent, that an outbreak in the family would be followed immediately by an outbreak among the hogs, and vice versa, as to present a most striking coincidence if not suggesting a close relation between the two conditions. It looked like &#8216;flu,&#8217; and until proven it was not &#8216;flu,&#8217; I shall stand by that diagnosis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to where the 1918 virus came from was </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16208372/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published in October 2005</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Humanity’s </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16306515/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greatest killer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appeared to originally come from avian influenza—bird flu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>What Is Bird Flu?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence now suggests that </span><a href="https://books.google.co.za/books/about/Infectious_Diseases.html?id=2fzEPgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pandemic influenza viruses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—in fact all human and mammalian flu viruses in general—owe their origins to avian influenza. Back in 1918, schoolchildren jumped rope to a </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47557431_Edvard_Munch_1863-1944_Self-Portrait_After_the_Spanish_Flu_1919-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">morbid little rhyme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a little bird,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its name was Enza.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened the window,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in-flu-enza.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Is Bird Flu Worse Than Regular Flu?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As devastating as the 1918 pandemic was, the mortality rate was </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051017024536/frist.senate.gov/_files/060105manhattan.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than 5 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on average. But the H5N1 strain of bird flu virus that </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885988/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first emerged in China in 1997</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and spread to more than 60 countries seems to kill about </span><a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/wpro-emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its known human victims, on par with some </span><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strains of Ebola</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making it potentially </span><a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/wpro-emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ten times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as deadly as the </span><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/mild-h5n1-cases-werent-missed-cambodian-outbreak"><span style="font-weight: 400;">worst plague</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in human history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading public health authorities, from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the World Health Organization, feared that this bird flu virus was but mutations away from spreading efficiently though the human population, triggering the next pandemic. “The lethal capacity of this virus is very, very high; so it’s a deadly virus that humans have not been exposed to before. That’s a </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-a-step-behind-bird-flu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very bad combination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Irwin Redlener, former director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. Scientists speculate worst-case scenarios in which H5N1 could end up </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230309010100/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/10/28/pandemic.shtml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killing a billion</span></a> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524853-100-editorial-bird-flu-outbreak-could-kill-1-5-billion-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">or more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people around the world. “The only thing I can think of that could take a larger human death toll would be thermonuclear war,” </span><a href="https://thetvdb.com/series/the-oprah-winfrey-show/episodes/326015"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Laurie Garrett. H5N1 has the potential to become a virus as ferocious as Ebola and as contagious as the common cold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>H1N1 vs. H5N1</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1918 pandemic virus was H1N1. The annual flu strain remained H1N1, infecting relatively few people every year for decades until 1957, when an H2N2 virus suddenly appeared as the “Asian flu” pandemic. Because the world’s population had essentially only acquired immunity to H1 spikes, the virus raced around the globe, infecting a significant portion of the world’s population. For example, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10774473/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of U.S. schoolchildren fell ill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. H2N2 held seasonal sway for 11 years. In 1968, the H3N2 “Hong Kong Flu” virus triggered another pandemic and has been with us every year since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there were three influenza pandemics in the twentieth century—in 1918, 1957, and 1968—but, as the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases </span><a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer/76102505/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “There are pandemics and then there are pandemics.” The half-and-half bird/human hybrid viruses of 1957 and 1968 evidently contained enough previously recognizable human structure that the human population’s prior partial exposure dampened the pandemic’s potential to do harm. In contrast, the pandemic strain of 1918 was </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278079378_The_1918_flu_virus_is_resurrected_vol_437_pg_794_2005"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wholly avian-like</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of diluting its alien avian nature, the 1918 bird flu virus “likely jumped straight to humans and began killing them,” </span><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/resurrecting-spanish-flu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Taubenberger, the man who helped resurrect it. The same could be happening with the new spate of avian influenza viruses sporadically infecting people in more recent years, like H5N1. The human immune system had never been known to be exposed to an H5 virus before. As the WHO points out, “Population vulnerability to an H5N1-like pandemic virus </span><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2005-07-01/next-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would be universal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>How Dangerous Is H5N1 Bird Flu?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H5N1 developed a level of human lethality not thought possible for influenza. So far, about </span><a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/wpro-emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of those</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known to have come down with this flu have died. H5N1 is good at killing, but not at spreading. To trigger a pandemic, the virus has to learn how to spread efficiently from person to person. Now that the genome of the 1918 virus has been completely sequenced, we understand that it may have taken only </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/05/health/deadly-1918-epidemic-linked-to-bird-flu-scientists-say.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a few dozen mutations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to turn a bird flu virus into humanity’s greatest killer, and we have seen some of those </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16208372/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changes taking form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in H5N1. The further H5N1 spreads and the more people it infects, the greater the likelihood that it might lock in mutations that could allow for efficient human-to-human transmission. “And that’s what keeps us up at night,” </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060427044910/http://www.azcentral.com/health/news/articles/1004birdflu04.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s task force on pandemic influenza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>How Did Bird Flu Emerge?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a century ago, </span><a href="https://catalog.nlm.nih.gov/permalink/01NLM_INST/1o1phhn/alma9912489983406676"><span style="font-weight: 400;">researchers confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first outbreak of a particularly lethal form of avian influenza that they called “fowl plague.” Plague comes from the Greek word meaning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“blow” or “strike</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Later, the name “fowl plague” was abandoned and replaced by </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11189716/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“highly pathogenic avian influenza”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or HPAI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domesticated poultry can also become infected with a </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-birds.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low-grade influenza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so-called low pathogenic avian influenza, or LPAI, which may cause a few ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production. Influenza viruses with H5 or H7 spikes, however, are able to mutate into the high-grade variety that can cause devastating illness among the birds. Webster’s term for H5 and H7 strains of flu says it all: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/07/birdflu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the nasty bastards.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And you don’t get nastier than H5.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Avian Influenza, Poultry, and Eggs</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid contracting bird flu, an influenza expert at the UK Health Protection Agency </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4ec06b16-4279-11da-94c2-00000e2511c8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “[a]void being in touching distance [of birds who could be affected]. Don’t kiss chickens.” Kissing aside, what is the risk of putting our lips on them in other ways?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2001, the virus was found and confirmed in frozen duck meat. The investigators concluded, “The isolation of an H5N1 influenza virus from duck meat and the presence of infectious virus in muscle tissue of experimentally infected ducks raises concern that meat produced by this species may serve as a </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12021367/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vehicle for the transmission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of H5N1 virus to humans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The finding of H5N1-contaminated poultry meat triggered a more extensive survey. Top flu researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) looked into chicken meat. Chickens who inhaled H5N1 became infected </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250062994_Transcript_of_the_Question_and_Answer_Sessions_from_the_Fifth_International_Symposium_on_Avian_Influenza"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even more systemically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than did ducks. The virus spread through the internal organs, into the muscle tissue, and even out into the skin. Virus was found in</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15839417/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both white and dark meat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a precedent for </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6261579/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bird-borne virus-infected meat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike bacteria, viruses can remain infective for prolonged periods even in processed foods. Some methods of preservation, like refrigeration, freezing, or salting, may even </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9413541/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extend the persistence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of viruses in food.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, since viruses cannot replicate without living tissue, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9413526/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improper storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of food is less problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about eggs? “Be careful with eggs,” the World Health Organization </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060306053903/www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/H5N1-9reduit.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Eggs from infected poultry could also be contaminated with the [H5N1] virus…”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Mutating and Getting More Virulent</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a single individual, a virus evolves, adapts, learns. It hits dead ends and tries something new, slowly notching up mutations that may lock into place the ability to effectively survive in, and transmit between, people. Every single person who gets infected presents a risk of spawning </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pandemic virus. Describes one virologist, “You’re playing Russian roulette every time you have a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081011054353/http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,901051017-1115613,00.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">human infection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Experts fear that as more and more people become infected, a virus will finally figure out the combination—the right combination of mutations to spread not just in one elevator or building, but in every building, everywhere, around the globe. Then it won’t just be peasant farmers in Vietnam dying after handling dead birds or raw poultry—it will be New Yorkers, Parisians, Londoners, and people in every city, township, and village in the world dying after shaking someone’s hand, touching a doorknob, or simply inhaling in the wrong place at the wrong time. It’s happened before, and it may soon happen again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Said a WHO spokesperson about a virus like H5N1, “All the indications are that we are </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1126722/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">living on borrowed time.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” A senior associate at the Center for Biosecurity </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette&amp;title=Officials%20gather%20today%20in%20New%20York%20to%20discuss%20how%20to%20stave%20off%20a%20potential%20pandemic%20flu%20threatening%20millions.%20Worse%20than%20hurricanes?&amp;author=C.%20Snowbeck&amp;publication_year=2005&amp;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listed the indications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “The lethality of the virus is unprecedented for influenza, the scope of the bird outbreak is completely unprecedented and the change that needs to happen to create a pandemic is such a small change—it could literally happen any day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never before H5N1 had bird flu </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Financial%20Times&amp;title=World%20%E2%80%9Cunprepared%E2%80%9D%20for%20flu%20pandemic&amp;author=A%20Ward&amp;author=M%20Turner&amp;publication_year=2005&amp;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so far, so fast, and the longer the virus circulates in poultry production systems the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54542-2005Feb25.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher the likelihood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of additional human exposure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Can H5N1 Be Eradicated?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H5N1 may be here to stay. “This virus cannot now be eradicated from the planet,” </span><a href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/2005/10/13/congress-told-to-prepare-quickly/50901837007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Center for Biosecurity director</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> O’Toole. “It is in too many birds in too many places.” The virus seemed to be getting more entrenched. “If you described it as a war, we’ve been losing more battles than we’ve won,” a WHO spokesperson told </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88cf6312-ee31-11d9-98e5-00000e2511c8"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial Times</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “From a public health point of view, and an animal health point of view, this virus is just getting a stronger and stronger grip on the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tone uncharacteristic of international policy institutions, the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060207100146/http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2005/100356/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAO wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Over this bleak landscape sits a black cloud of fear that the virus might become adapted to enable human-to-human transmission and then spread around the globe.” The </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14765155/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urgency and alarm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among those tracking H5N1’s building momentum was palpable. “It’s like watching a volcano getting ready to erupt,” described a spokesperson of the </span><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/tackle-bird-flu-at-its-source-vet-urges-20051017-gdm9io.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Organization for Animal Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (known as OIE, for Office Internationale des Epizooties). “We’re all holding our breath,” </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-preparing-world-s-next-big-flu-outbreak-flna1c9446591"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Julie Gerberding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former head of the CDC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Breeding Grounds for Disease</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s three leading authorities—the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the World Organization for Animal Health—held a joint consultation in 2004 to determine the key underlying causes. Four main </span><a href="https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/68899"><span style="font-weight: 400;">risk factors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the emergence and spread of these diseases were identified. Bulleted first: “Increasing demand for animal protein.” This has led to what the CDC refers to as “the intensification of food-animal production,” the factor blamed in part for the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15041202/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing threat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way we kept animals when we first domesticated them ten thousand years ago is a far cry from how they are reared today. Chickens used to run around the barnyard on small farms. Now, “broiler” chickens—those raised for meat—are typically warehoused in long sheds confining an average of 20,000 to </span><a href="https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/broiler-housing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25,000 birds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A single corporation, </span><a href="https://ir.tyson.com/about-tyson/facts/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can churn out more than 20 million pounds of chicken meat a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">day.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Worldwide, an estimated</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060209113420/www.uepcertified.com/industryhistory.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 70 to 80 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of egg-laying chickens are intensively confined in battery cages, small barren wire enclosures stacked several tiers high and extending down long rows in </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070221131333/www.ciwf.org.uk/publications/reports/laid_bare_2002.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">windowless sheds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cages are stocked at such densities that each hen is typically allotted less floor space than a standard </span><a href="https://uepcertified.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Caged-UEP-Guidelines_17.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter-sized piece of paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is not uncommon for egg producers to keep </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060520031515/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/newsltr/v14n2/sa-1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of thousands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—or even a million—hens confined on a single farm. Half the world’s </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060615173830/https://www.worldwatch.org/node/819"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pig population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—now approaching one billion—is also crowded into industrial confinement operations. This represents the </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3371818/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most profound alteration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the animal-human relationship in ten thousand years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>What Can We Do?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce the emergence of viruses like H5N1, humanity must shift toward raising birds in smaller flocks, under less stressful, less crowded, and more hygienic conditions, with outdoor access, no use of human antivirals, and with an end to the practice of breeding for rapid growth or unnatural egg production at the expense of immunity. This would also be </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21192848/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected to reduce rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of increasingly antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salmonella,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the number one foodborne killer in the United States. We need to move away from the industry’s fire-fighting approach to infectious disease to a more proactive preventive health approach that makes birds less susceptible—even resilient—to disease in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, the American Public Health Association (APHA) is among those advocating for “radical” (</span><a href="https://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the.html?id=GsgqnwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the Latin </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">radix</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for “root”) change. In 2003, the APHA passed a “</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060102045244/www.apha.org/legislative/policy/2003/2003-007.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precautionary Moratorium on New Concentrated Animal Feed Operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” in which it urged all federal, state, and local authorities to impose an immediate moratorium on the building of new factory farms—including industrial turkey, laying hen, broiler chicken, and duck facilities. In November 2019, it reiterated its stance, publishing a </span><a href="https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2020/01/13/precautionary-moratorium-on-new-and-expanding-concentrated-animal-feeding-operations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new policy statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calling once again for a moratorium on new factory farms, as well as a moratorium on the expansion of existing ones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Eating to Beat Bird Flu</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journal of the APHA published an editorial entitled “</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1963309/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chickens Come Home to Roost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” that went beyond just calling for a deintensification of the pork and poultry industries. The editorial questioned the prudence of raising so many animals for food in the first place, given the pandemic threat they may pose: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is curious, therefore, that changing the way humans treat animals, most basically ceasing to eat them, or at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten—is largely off the radar as a significant preventive measure. Such a change, if sufficiently adopted or imposed, could still reduce the chances of the much-feared influenza epidemic. It would be even more likely to prevent unknown future diseases that, in the absence of this change, may result from farming animals intensively and killing them for food. Yet humanity doesn’t even consider this option.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, thanks to food innovations, this may be changing, with plant-based meats, milks, and eggs growing in popularity with expanded options in supermarkets. And, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14711290/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making healthier choices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could also help mediate the next coronavirus epidemic by also decreasing the rates of comorbidities found to increase the risk in SARS, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27608662/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MERS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and COVID-19. For example, consider the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32271993/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">underlying risk factors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for COVID-19 severity and death—obesity, heart disease, hypertension, and </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32173574/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">type 2 diabetes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—all of which can be </span><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controlled or even reversed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a healthy enough plant-based diet and lifestyle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Egg-Free Eggs</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many delicious egg-free egg recipes, like this </span><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/recipe/garden-veggie-tempeh-scramble/"><b>Garden Veggie Tempeh Scramble</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created by NutritionFacts.org’s own executive director.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H5N1 was discovered in chickens decades ago, a flu virus that would forever change our understanding of how bad pandemics could get—a flu virus that appears capable of killing half the people it infects. Imagine if a virus like that started explosively spreading from human to human. Consider a pandemic a hundred times worse than COVID-19, one with a fatality rate not of one in two hundred but rather a coin flip of one in two. Thankfully, H5N1 has so far remained a virus mainly of poultry, not people, but H5N1 and other new and deadly animal viruses like it are still out there, still mutating, with an eye on the eight-billion-strong buffet of human hosts. With pandemics, it’s never a matter of if, but when. A universal outbreak with more than a few percent mortality wouldn’t just threaten financial markets but civilization itself as we know it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pandemic triggered by a bird flu virus could leave </span><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/foreign-affairs-focuses-pandemic-threat"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of millions</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dead. “An influenza pandemic of even moderate impact,” Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, wrote, “will result in the biggest single human disaster ever—far greater than AIDS, 9/11, all wars in the 20th century and the recent tsunami combined. It has the potential to redirect world history as the Black Death redirected European history in the 14th century.”<sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hopefully, for humanity’s sake, the direction world history will take is away from raising birds by the billions under intensive confinement so as to potentially lower the risk of us ever being in this same precarious place in the future. The silver lining of COVID-19 is that the world will be better prepared for the next global health crisis. Tragically, it may take a pandemic with a virus like H5N1 before the world realizes the true cost of cheap chicken.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[What do hospitals have to say for themselves about serving meals that appear to be designed to inspire repeat business? “Hospital food needs a revolution.” [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do hospitals have to say for themselves about serving meals that appear to be designed to inspire repeat business?</p>
<p>“Hospital food <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21140886/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needs</a> a revolution.” I was surprised to learn that most inpatient meals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26320410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served</a> in hospitals are “not required to meet national nutrition standards for a healthy diet.” An analysis of the nutritional value of food served to patients in teaching hospitals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8927088/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that many did not meet dietary recommendations. “Warning: Hospital food bad for health,” <a href="https://nutritionfacts.box.com/s/h98xo8jqu902xsz4dnu0xioww7yauo9k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read</a> the headline.</p>
<p>A registered dietitian <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9121534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> to defend hospitals and point out how stringent the guidelines are, saying that “over half the hospitals met or exceeded more than half the guidelines….It would not take more than choosing eggs for breakfast and 2 percent milk with meals to exceed the recommended intake of cholesterol and fat…The provocative conclusions of Singer et al. only lead the media and the public to conclude that we are a bunch of dunces who have no understanding of the relation between nutrition and disease prevention.”</p>
<p>Well, if the white coat fits…</p>
<p>“We <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20921246/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend</a> a fortune on training doctors, but then don’t follow through on the simplest things, like food.” “Good diet <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673645915455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> as necessary to recovery of health as good nursing, surgery, or medicine, and it is folly to pretend that it is beyond the power of our profession to change this reproach.” That was written 75 years ago, yet still there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9121532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> pushback: “Perhaps we should question whether a ‘healthy diet’ given to a helpless patient during a 2- to 10-day hospital stay benefits anyone or anything other than the dietitian’s sense of ‘doing good,’” responded one doctor. He added, “I am always bothered when a healthy 75-year-old…is deprived of a desired morning egg because a ‘healthy’ low-cholesterol diet has been ordered.” I mean, what <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26746678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> a few days of a little heart-<em>unfriendly</em> diet in the scheme of things…</p>
<p>But it’s the message that’s being <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9850103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a>. “The presence of foods on the [hospital] tray sends a message to patients as to what is healthy and acceptable for them to eat,” responded the researchers who did the hospital foods analysis. “We still can think of no better place or opportunity to set an example of good nutrition than when patients are in hospitals.”</p>
<p>After all, public schools in California, for instance, have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23445326/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned</a> the sale of sodas for more than a decade. Why not children’s hospitals? In a study of California healthcare facilities serving children, 75 percent of beverages and 81 percent of foods sold in vending machines wouldn’t have been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19470605/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed</a> to be sold in schools. We’re talking soda and candy. “Having unhealthy items in health care facilities and seeing staff consume these products…contradicts the nutrition and health messages children often receive from health care providers.”</p>
<p>On adult menus, nearly all meals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22801878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contained</a> excess salt, with 100 percent of daily menus exceeding the American Heart Association’s recommendation for staying under 1,500 mg of sodium a day. This means meals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22801578/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered</a> to patients may actually “contribute to the exacerbation or slow resolution of the very conditions that may have led to the hospitalization,” as I discuss in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-just-how-bad-is-hospital-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just How Bad Is Hospital Food?</a></strong>.</p>
<p>But if hospitals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23479107/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adhered</a> to the recommended limits of salt, the food wouldn’t taste as good, responded an executive from the Salt Institute, to which the researchers replied: Taste as good? “Hospital food is often criticized as having poor palatability, despite the fact that it likely already contains high levels of sodium.” It doesn’t taste good, no matter how much salt it has.</p>
<p>At the very least, we should “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22801578/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepare</a> all meals with low sodium content and make optional table salt available for those patients who do not have additional restrictions.” Then, if individuals want to add salt, it’s their choice. If they want to get someone to wheel them out into the parking lot and smoke, that’s their business, but we shouldn’t be blowing cigarette smoke into patients’ rooms three times a day, whether they want it or not. Interestingly, studies suggest that when people are allowed to salt food to taste, they rarely add as much sodium as may come in prepackaged foods.</p>
<p>As you can see below and at 3:55 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-just-how-bad-is-hospital-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, when researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3682116/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> study participants to a low-sodium diet, they used their saltshakers more, but, overall, their salt intake dipped way down. And they said their food tasted just as salty, because salt <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2596842/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> to the surface of foods makes it taste saltier. But when a hospital meal is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22801578/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served</a> pre-salted, “most inpatients may not actually have the option to consume healthy levels of sodium while they are hospitalized.” </p>

<p>In defense of their unhealthy food, one hospital food service provider <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29786502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that they’re just giving people what they want: “People are in the hospital and they are stressed and they need something that they consider comfort food, so I don’t want to deny that to people if that’s what makes them feel better.” That’s a reason one clinical director <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9850101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sends</a> ice cream and candy bars to cancer patients: “We focus on familiar comfort foods, an approach that has enhanced patient satisfaction and improved intake.” You know what else might help? A nice, long drag on a cigarette. Hospitals used to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4068176/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell</a> cigarettes, “primarily…for ‘patient convenience.’” “‘I don’t think I can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/09/archives/hospitals-act-to-curb-cigarette-sales-smoking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deny</a> a paying patient the right to smoke a cigarette,’” said a medical center administrator. “‘As a service to the patient, I will have to insist we have cigarette machines in the hospital.” But others <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3999280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that tobacco products shouldn’t be sold in hospitals at all. This wasn’t from the 1950s, but from the 1980s. Yet, at the time, the “irony of hospitals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4068176/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowing</a> the sale of cigarettes, which are the major cause of preventable illness and death in this country, has rarely been discussed in the literature…It is especially ironic that smoking is permitted in 89% of doctors’ lounges.”</p>
<p>To their credit, though, U.S. hospitals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14759925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underwent</a> “the first industry-wide ban on smoking in the workplace” by the mid-1990s. Now, “hospitals again <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22801578/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> the opportunity to take the lead and to create food environments that are consistent with their mission to cure the sick and to promote health. Through the simple act of serving food that meets national nutritional standards, our hospitals will act in the best health interests of their patients, and their staff, and will undoubtedly again be leaders in our ongoing dialogue on how to improve our food supply, which in turn will improve the health of us all.”</p>
<p>“Strict antismoking regulations have frequently been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3999280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> as too harsh or difficult to enforce, as if disease and premature death brought on by smoking were any easier to accept and control.” Think my smoking-diet parallel is hyperbole? Well, guess what? Today, the major cause of preventable illness and death in this country is no longer tobacco.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardiologists can criminally game the system by telling patients they have much more serious, unstable diseases than they really have—fraud that results in unnecessary procedures, unnecessary costs, and unnecessary patient harm.</p>
<p>“The history of medicine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24084919/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abounds</a> with dogmas assumed and later overcome”—sometimes, much later. The Women’s Health Initiative study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12207419/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> that giving women Premarin, a hormone replacement therapy, increased the risk of the number one killer of women, heart disease, as well as breast cancer risk. Millions of women <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837433/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped</a> taking it, and breast cancer rates came down.</p>
<p>Another such reversal of an established medical practice is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)—angioplasty and stents for stable coronary artery disease. Billions of dollars are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22215160/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent</a> on procedures <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> “unequivocally” to offer no benefits.</p>
<p>So, why are cardiologists still doing them? Researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17698682/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20The%20widespread%20application%20of,influence%20on%20physician%20decision%20making." target="_blank" rel="noopener">did</a> some focus groups and concluded: “Although cardiologists may believe they are benefiting their stable patients with CAD [coronary artery disease] by performing PCI, this belief appears to be based on emotional and psychological factors rather than on evidence of clinical benefits.”</p>
<p>“The sense of irrationality <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surrounding</a> this practice is so strong that the phenomenon has been coined the oculostenotic reflex (I see a stenosis; I stent it).” They see a narrowing and stent it as though they can’t even help themselves.</p>
<p>Since the procedure <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html#:~:text=A%20procedure%20used%20to%20relieve,cages%2C%20to%20open%20blocked%20arteries." target="_blank" rel="noopener">carries</a> some risks, including death, there’s an argument that stents should only be used for individuals who are actively having heart attacks and are in an emergency or unstable situation. Thankfully, there <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26550932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> now published, appropriate-use criteria in place to help guide cardiologists, and the good news is that 82 percent of stents are “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871374/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> to be performed in emergency or unstable situations.” So, we can disregard that ORBITA study that showed there was no benefit in stable patients since it’s now almost always performed only in unstable patients, right? Well, that’s how it&#8217;s almost always reported. “There are 2 ways a physician can become compliant. One is to do fewer unnecessary procedures”—which is the whole point (but where’s the money in that?)—“and the other is to make unnecessary procedures seem necessary.”</p>
<p>Is the implication that a doctor would try to game the system by telling a patient that they had a much more serious, unstable disease than they actually had, so the procedure could be carried out anyway? This is referred to as “upcoding.” Another word for it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30556826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would</a> be “fraud.” Researchers found that “some of that decline [in inappropriate use] may be driven by upcoding, falsely and intentionally misclassifying patients with stable angina as UA,” having unstable angina. As soon as those appropriate-use criteria <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871374/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went</a> into effect, suspiciously, there was a four- to tenfold greater increase in rates of stents for acute coronary syndromes like heart attacks. “In New York, the proportion of PCIs <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30556822/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labeled</a> as acute, but performed as outpatient procedures, increased 14-fold&#8230;” There’s no biologically plausible reason why that would <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30556826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happen</a>, so they were unnecessary procedures with unnecessary cost and unnecessary patient harm. And harm not only from the risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871374/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> an unnecessary stent but also from lying to the patient by exaggerating how bad their heart disease is. “This practice, at best, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30556826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damages</a> the credibility of the profession, increases health care spending, violates patient autonomy, puts the patient at risk of procedural complications and, at worse, may cross the threshold into criminal activity…”</p>
<p>What’s the solution? There <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871374/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could</a> be an independent review panel to protect patients. “Simpler might be to remove the financial incentive to perform more procedures.”</p>
<p>“How many established standards of medical care <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22215160/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> wrong? It is not known.” Bloodletting was the standard of care for thousands of years, for example. “Rigorous questioning of long-established practices is difficult. There are thousands of clinical trials, but most deal with trivialities or efforts to buttress the sales of specific products. Given this conundrum, it is possible that some entire medical subspecialties are based on little evidence.”</p>
<p>In the landmark COURAGE trial that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30384885/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> stents were useless for extending life, what did seem to determine longevity? Ironically, in the case of heart stents, it was how many risk factors the patients were able to control. Those who achieved all six by lowering their blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, and smoking, while improving their diets and activity, had five times the survival over the subsequent 14 years than those who didn’t, as shown below and at 4:36 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-stents-and-upcoding-how-cardiologists-game-the-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heart Stents and Upcoding: How Cardiologists Game the System</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Should we be surprised that angioplasty and stents <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30591431/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fail</a> to improve prognosis? After all, they do nothing to modify the underlying disease process itself. In other words, it doesn’t treat the cause. Even if stents <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10496449/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped</a> with symptoms beyond the placebo effect, they would still just be treating the symptoms and not the disease. So, it’s no wonder the disease continues to progress until the patient is disabled to death. Dr. Esselstyn wrote, “Thus, the leading killer of men and women in Western civilization is being left untreated. What is being practiced is ‘palliative cardiology’: nontreatment of heart disease leading to disease extension and frequently an eventual fatal outcome.”</p>
<p>Deaths by the planeload every week, are “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30202287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regarded</a> as unfortunate,” rather than a national, preventable tragedy. “It is as though in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ignoring</a> this dairy, oil, and animal-based illness, we are wedded to providing futile attempts at temporary symptomatic relief”—rather than the cure.</p>
<p>Thankfully, “we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30202287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> on the cusp of a seismic revolution in health…not another pill, procedure, or operation,” but instead treating the underlying cause of heart disease with whole food, plant-based nutrition, “the mightiest tool medicine has ever had in its toolbox.”</p>
<p>To get there, we need to fight a key nutrition deficiency in education. A study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28551044/#:~:text=Results%3A%20A%20total%20of%20930,nutrition%20education%20in%20medical%20school." target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that 90 percent of cardiologists reported receiving no or minimal nutrition education during their cardiology training, leaving fewer than one in ten feeling confident in their nutrition knowledge. So, maybe it’s a good thing that most spend just three minutes or less discussing nutrition with their patients. Only one in five cardiologists themselves even ate five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this lifesaving information is slowly but surely <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30337277/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> out there. “Medical education has focused on being the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff rather than a fence at the top. Money talks, and there’s very little money in promoting eating broccoli and going for a walk, despite them being much more effective.” I was so eager to see the citation they used for that and was so honored when I did, as shown below and at 7:14 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-stents-and-upcoding-how-cardiologists-game-the-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Again and again, studies have shown that doctors tend to make clinical decisions for patients based on how much they themselves will get paid.</p>
<p>In 2007, we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17387127/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> from the COURAGE trial that angioplasty and stents—percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)—don’t reduce the risk of death or heart attack, but patients didn’t seem to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> the memo. Only 1 percent realize there was no mortality or heart attack benefit, perhaps because most cardiologists <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25156523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fail</a> to mention that fact. One can imagine that if patients actually <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23283351/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understood</a> that symptomatic relief was all they were going to get, with “no additional mortality benefits,” they’d be less likely to go under the knife. Then, ten years later, the ORBITA trial was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a>, showing even the <em>promise</em> of symptom relief was an illusion.</p>
<p>“The implications of ORBITA <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> profound and far-reaching. First and foremost, the results of ORBITA show unequivocally that there are no benefits for PCI compared with medical therapy for stable angina,” that is, heart disease. Basically, patients would be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29595128/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risking</a> “harm for no benefit. It is hard to imagine a scenario where a fully informed patient would choose an additional invasive treatment for no added benefit.” Remember the stent consent form I <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20332406/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> previously, shown below and at 1:17 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/why-are-stents-still-used-if-they-dont-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Are Stents Still Used If They Don’t Work?</a></strong>: </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113075" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/screenshot-2025-03-22-at-210233.png" alt="" width="1079" height="638" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/screenshot-2025-03-22-at-210233.png 1079w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/screenshot-2025-03-22-at-210233-960x568.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/screenshot-2025-03-22-at-210233-1024x605.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/screenshot-2025-03-22-at-210233-768x454.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/screenshot-2025-03-22-at-210233-720x426.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/screenshot-2025-03-22-at-210233-540x319.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px" /></p>
<p>Now, it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20332406/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks</a> like this, seen below and at 1:21.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113073" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-17-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>So, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> the ORBITA trial the “last nail in the coffin for PCI in stable angina?” That is, for stents in non-emergency situations? An editorial in the journal <em>Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine</em> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29941178/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disagreed</a>, pointing to “the broad angina relief that occurred in both arms.” In other words, stents helped—even if the sham operation without stents helped just as much. So, “if the patient is treated with PCI and is benefiting from the ‘placebo effect,’ who am I to interfere with that beneﬁt of this ‘therapy’?” In that case, why not perform fake surgeries? Stent placement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can</a> cost around $40,000. It’d be cheaper to just fake it all. The reason we shouldn’t <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep</a> electively stenting people is because there’s a body count. During stent placement, 2 percent of patients <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29425088/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">develop</a> bleeding or blood vessel damage, while another 1 percent die or have a heart attack or a stroke. And because something is stuck in your chest, 3 percent of patients have a bleeding event from the blood thinners that must be taken. Or the blood thinners don’t work and the stent clots off and causes a heart attack.</p>
<p>Why are they still done when we not only don’t have evidence of benefit but, in many cases, we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> explicit “evidence of no benefit”? One of the sources of resistance may be all the financial gain. These procedures <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322809/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make</a> a lot of money for hospitals. Don’t expect them to begin promoting “lifestyle changes to combat heart disease. Nor will physicians quickly abandon a practice that both supports their income and seems to make sense.” Is it that simple? <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24473450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is</a> it that famous Upton Sinclair quote: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” Think that’s just cynicism? Let’s ask doctors themselves.</p>
<p>Thousands of physicians were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28877170/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveyed</a>, and 70 percent “believed that physicians provide unnecessary procedures when they profit from them.” That’s what doctors themselves believe. And the data <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15076830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear</a> this out. Doctors have been shown to make clinical decisions for patients based on how much they get paid. For example, when <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23124970/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choosing</a> which chemotherapy to treat breast cancer, increasing a physician’s margin by 10 percent can yield up to a 177 percent increase in the likelihood of choosing one drug over another.</p>
<p>That may be why Caesarean sections “are more likely to be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28213600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> by for-profit hospitals as compared with non-profit hospitals.” “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19399752/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operating</a> on commission.” Pay surgeons per procedure, and you can increase surgery rates by 78 percent. Could that explain why we <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do</a> 101 percent more angioplasties than any other affluent country? A study on “physicians’ ﬁnancial incentives and treatment choices in heart attack management” found that they do indeed “respond positively to the payments they receive and that the response is quite large&#8230;Unconditionally, plans that pay physicians more for more invasive treatments are associated with a larger fraction of such treatments,” seeming to result in more invasive treatments. So, it may actually be quite common for patients to receive different treatments based on whether the doctor is getting paid per procedure.</p>
<p>One of my heroes, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn—who always <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30202287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tries</a> to see the best in people—had to admit that compensation may be playing a role. Evidence <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21866582/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surfaced</a> that “doctors have run up millions of dollars in medical bills by doing unnecessary stent implants,” doctors like Mark Midei who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/health/06stent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inserted</a> 30 stents in a single day. That could be about a million dollars worth of billing. As a token of gratitude, a sales representative from the stent company spent more than $2,000 to buy “a whole slow-smoked pig, peach cobbler, and other fixings for a barbecue dinner at Dr. Midei’s home.”</p>
<p>“The US is just about the only developed country where health care is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21866582/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered</a> on a fee-per-service basis and we very liberally incentivize physicians for doing invasive procedures,” explained the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “The economic incentives are just too strong.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sham surgery trials prove that procedures like non-emergency stents offer no benefit for angina pain—only risk to millions of patients. </p>
<p>Angioplasty and stents—percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)—for stable, non-emergency coronary artery disease <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20820045/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> among “the most common invasive procedures performed in the United States.” Though they appeared to offer immediate relief of angina chest pain in stable patients with coronary artery disease, that didn’t actually translate into a lower risk of heart attack or death. This is because the atherosclerotic plaques that <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29425088/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow</a> blood flow tend not to be the ones that burst and kill us. Symptom control <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29425083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is</a> important, though, and is much of what we do in medicine, but cardiology has a bad track record when it comes to <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13720382/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performing</a> procedures that don’t actually end up helping at all.</p>
<p>Case in point: internal mammary artery ligation. Though it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13548038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t</a> make much anatomical sense—why would tying off arteries to the chest wall and breast somehow improve coronary artery circulation?—it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13548038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked</a> like a charm with immediate improvement in 95 percent of hundreds of patients. Could it have just been an elaborate placebo effect, and surgeons were cutting into people for nothing? There’s only one way to find out: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13816818/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cut</a> into people for nothing.</p>
<p>As I discuss in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-heart-stent-procedures-work-for-angina-chest-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Heart Stent Procedures Work for Angina Chest Pain?</a></strong>, people were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13816818/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randomized</a> to get the actual surgery or a sham (or fake) surgery where patients were cut open and the surgeon got to the last step but didn’t actually tie off those arteries. The result? “Patients who underwent a sham operation experienced the same relief.” Check out the testimonials: “Practically immediately, I felt better.” “I’m about 95 percent better.” “No chest trouble even with exercise.” “Believe I’m cured.” And these are all people who got the <em>fake surgery</em>. So, it was just an extravagant placebo effect. Think about it. “The frightened, poorly informed man with angina [chest pain], winding himself tighter and tighter, sensitizing himself to every twinge of chest discomfort, who then comes into the environment of a great medical center and a powerful positive personality and sees and hears the results to be anticipated from the suggested therapy is not the same total patient who leaves the institution with the trademark scar.” He hears how great he’s going to feel, goes through the whole operation, and leaves a new man with that trademark scar.</p>
<p>One sham patient was actually cured, though. “The patient is optimistic and says he feels much better.” The next day’s office note reads: “Patient dropped dead following moderate exertion.” This has happened over and over.</p>
<p>What if we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16286164/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burn</a> holes into the heart muscle with lasers to create channels for blood flow? It seemed to work great until it was proven that it doesn’t work at all. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21218553/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cutting</a> the nerves to our kidneys was heralded as a cure for hard-to-treat high blood pressure until sham surgery <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24678939/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proved</a> that procedure was a sham, too. “The necessity for placebo-controlled trials has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rediscovered</a> several times in cardiology, typically to considerable surprise.” Before they are debunked, “often a therapy is thought to be so beneficial that a placebo-controlled trial is deemed unnecessary and perhaps unethical.” That was the case with stents.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of angioplasties and stents are done every year, yet placebo-controlled trials have never been done. Why? Because cardiologists were so unquestioningly sure it worked “that it might be unethical to expose patients to an invasive placebo procedure.” Why perform a fake surgery to prove something we already know is true? “When patients <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30242142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> aware they have had PCI, they have a clear reduction in angina and improved quality of life.” But what if they weren’t aware they had a stent placed inside them? Would it still work?  </p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enter</a> the ORBITA trial. After all, “anti-anginal medication<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30242142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> is</a> only taken seriously if there is blinded evidence of symptom relief” against a placebo pill, so why not pit stents against a placebo procedure? “In both groups, doctors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threaded</a> a catheter through the groin or wrist of the patient and, with X-ray guidance, up to the blocked artery. Once the catheter reached the blockage, the doctor inserted a stent or, if the patient was getting the sham procedure, simply pulled the catheter out.”</p>
<p>The researchers had problems <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208573/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> the study funded. They were told: “We know the answer to this question—of course, PCI works.” And that’s even what the researchers themselves thought. They were interventional cardiologists themselves. They just wanted to prove it. Boy, were they surprised. Even in patients with severe coronary artery narrowing, angioplasty and stents did not <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase</a> exercise time more than the fake procedure.</p>
<p>“Unbelievable,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read</a> the <em>New York Times</em> headline, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31163269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarking</a> that the results “stunned leading cardiologists by countering decades of clinical experience.” In response to the blowback, the researchers <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(18)31190-5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that they “sympathize with our community’s shock and its instinct to invalidate the trial. Applying a positive spin could have smoothed the reception of the trial, but as authors we have a duty to preserve scientific integrity.”</p>
<p>While some “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commended</a> them for challenging the existing dogma around a procedure that has become routine, ingrained, and profitable,” others <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29741525/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questioned</a> their ethics. After all, four patients in the placebo group had complications from the insertion of the guide wire and required emergency measures to seal the tear made in the artery. There <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> also three major bleeding events in the placebo group, so they suffered risks without even a chance of benefit. But “far from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29595128/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrating</a> the risks of sham-controlled PCI trials, this demonstrates exactly what patients are being subjected to on a routine basis, without evidence of benefit.”</p>
<p>Those few complications in the trial “are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dwarfed</a> in magnitude” by the thousands who have been maimed or even killed by the procedure over the years. Do you want unethical? How about the fact that an invasive procedure has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29664742/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> on millions of people before it was ever actually put to the test? Maybe “we should <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076810/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consider</a> the absence, not the presence, of sham control trials to be the greater injustice.”</p>
<p>When a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/889670#vp_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> at the American Heart Association meeting “whether sham controls should be required for device approval, he thought that it was more of a decision for the clinical community: ‘Do you want to get the truth or not?’”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What do physicians and stent companies have to say for themselves, given that they promote expensive, risky procedures with no benefit? “Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)”—angioplasty [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do physicians and stent companies have to say for themselves, given that they promote expensive, risky procedures with no benefit?</p>
<p>“Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)”—angioplasty and stent placement—“continues to be frequently <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29425088/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> for patients with stable [non-emergency] coronary artery disease, despite clear evidence that it provides minimal beneﬁt…” The procedure does not prevent heart attacks or death for patients with stable angina pectoris, for example, yet nearly nine out of ten patients mistakenly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20820040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believed</a> that it would reduce their chances of having a heart attack. “At the same time, the cardiologists who referred them for PCI and those who performed the procedure generally did not believe that PCI reduces the risk for MI [myocardial infarction or heart attack] in stable angina.” Then why on earth were they doing it?</p>
<p>“Focus groups of cardiologists have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22985786/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> a chasm between knowledge and behavior; while aware of the results of clinical trials”—that is, evidence to the contrary—“they recommend and perform PCI because they believe that it helps in some ill-deﬁned way.” “Physicians <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18618192/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended</a> to justify a non-evidence-based approach (‘I know the data shows there is no benefit, but’) by focusing on the ease of PCI and belief that an open artery was better”—even if it doesn’t actually affect outcomes—“while minimizing the risks of PCI.” The procedure only kills 1 in 150, so some are blaming the patients for not listening, but maybe the physicians are the ones who are ignoring the evidence.</p>
<p>Or “physicians may <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17892979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> too poor a grasp of relevant statistics to adequately inform their patients.” Regardless, what we have is “a failure to communicate.” So, tools have been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20332406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed</a>. For example, a sample informed consent document lays out the potential benefits and risks, even laying out how many procedures doctors have performed and any out-of-pocket costs. As you can see below and at 1:58 in my video <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/angioplasty-heart-stent-risks-vs-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angioplasty Heart Stent Risks vs. Benefits</a></strong>, there are a lot of blanks to be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20332406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filled</a> in. What are some concrete numbers? </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113052" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/1-58-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>As you can see below and at 2:20 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/angioplasty-heart-stent-risks-vs-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23226223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> up with some prototype decision-making tools. In terms of benefits, “Will having a stent placed in my heart prevent heart attacks or death? No. Stents will not lower the risk of heart attack or death,” but a week later those getting stents report they feel better—though, a year later, even the symptomatic-relief benefit appears to disappear. Nevertheless, there appeared to be a benefit of temporary relief of chest pain. What about the risks? </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113054" src="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20.png 1920w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20-960x540.png 960w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20-768x432.png 768w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20-480x270.png 480w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20-1200x675.png 1200w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20-720x405.png 720w, https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2025/04/2-20-540x304.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>As shown below and at 2:53 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/angioplasty-heart-stent-risks-vs-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, during the stent procedure, out of a hundred people, two will <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28110953" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> bleeding or damage to a blood vessel and one will have a more serious complication, such as heart attack, stroke, or death. Then, during the first year after the stent placement, three will have a bleeding event because of the blood thinners that must be taken because of the foreign material in the heart, but that doesn’t always work, so two people will have their stent clog off, leading to a heart attack. </p>

<p>What does the world’s number one stent manufacturer have to say for itself? It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30527778/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledges</a> that the evidence shows that stents don’t make people live longer, but the manufacturer thinks living longer is overrated. If we only cared about living longer, in medicine, “entire disciplines would dwindle or even disappear, such as dermatology, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, and dentistry.” So why go to the dentist? Of course, the difference is that 80 percent of people don’t <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20820040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe</a> that getting a cavity filled is going to save their life, like they mistakenly do for stents, as shown here and at 3:18 in my <strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/angioplasty-heart-stent-risks-vs-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a></strong>, and there isn’t a one in a hundred chance you won’t make it out of the dentist chair. </p>

<p>The stent companies actively misinform with ads making heart-warming copy. “<a href="https://nutritionfacts.app.box.com/s/c1096twi5qqyeb21vuv9a6kadw299lnz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open</a> your heart and your life.” “When you <a href="https://nutritionfacts.app.box.com/s/ip6tmihsq6ulx80jzwii6uoy8w0blbay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open</a> up your heart, you open up your life. LIFE WIDE OPEN.” “Freedom <a href="https://nutritionfacts.app.box.com/s/pf9dm5c7jvjs73ee3yhjav5yu3l1xya6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begins</a> here.” Their TV ads mention a few side effects, but it turns out they <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18480195/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">missed</a> a few. More importantly, they’re giving the false impression that stents are more than just expensive, risky band-aids for temporary symptom relief. But what’s wrong with symptom relief? Even if the benefits <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23226223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> only symptomatic and won’t last long, what’s the problem if people think that outweighs the risk?</p>
<p>What if I told you that even the symptom relief <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/11/placebo-effect-of-the-heart/545012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might</a> just be an elaborate placebo effect, and you <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-fake-surgery-exposes-useless-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could</a> get the same relief from a fake surgery, so there really aren’t any benefits at all? We’ll see what the science says—next. </p>
