			<title>This bedtime snack swap could rewire your gut and help prevent diabetes</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250724040505.htm</link>
			<description>A new study reveals that swapping a typical nighttime carbohydrate snack for pistachios may beneficially alter gut bacteria in people with prediabetes. Conducted by Penn State researchers, the 12-week clinical trial found that pistachio consumption increased beneficial gut microbes like Roseburia and reduced harmful ones such as Blautia hydrogenotrophica. These microbiome changes could potentially support metabolic health and slow the progression to Type 2 diabetes. While more research is needed to confirm health outcomes, this study positions pistachios as a promising late-night snack with microbiome-boosting potential.</description>

			<title>Three-person DNA IVF stops inherited disease—eight healthy babies born in UK first</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250718031218.htm</link>
			<description>In a groundbreaking UK first, eight healthy babies have been born using an IVF technique that includes DNA from three people—two parents and a female donor. The process, known as pronuclear transfer, was designed to prevent the inheritance of devastating mitochondrial diseases passed down through the mother’s DNA. The early results are highly promising: all the babies are developing normally, and the disease-causing mutations are undetectable or present at levels too low to cause harm. For families once haunted by genetic risk, this science offers more than treatment—it offers transformation.</description>

			<title>CRISPR uncovers gene that supercharges vitamin D—and stops tumors in their tracks</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250718031208.htm</link>
			<description>A gene called SDR42E1 has been identified as a key player in how our bodies absorb and process vitamin D. Researchers found that disabling this gene in colorectal cancer cells not only crippled their survival but also disrupted thousands of other genes tied to cancer and metabolism. This opens the door to highly targeted cancer therapies—by either cutting off vitamin D supply to tumors or enhancing the gene’s activity to boost health. The findings hint at vast possibilities in treating diseases influenced by vitamin D, though long-term impacts remain uncertain.</description>

			<title>Fasting twice a week could be a game-changer for type 2 diabetes</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250715043351.htm</link>
			<description>A new study comparing three popular diets—intermittent fasting, time-restricted eating, and continuous calorie cutting—found that all can help people with type 2 diabetes lose weight and lower blood sugar. But one diet stood out: the 5:2 intermittent fasting plan, where participants eat normally five days a week and restrict calories on two. It led to better results in fasting blood sugar, insulin response, and sticking with the plan.</description>

			<title>Sweet but risky: Common sweeteners may be accelerating puberty in kids</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250714052231.htm</link>
			<description>Kids who consume artificial and natural sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose, and glycyrrhizin may face an increased risk of early puberty, especially if they carry specific genetic markers. This large-scale Taiwanese study links sweeteners to hormonal changes and gut bacteria imbalances that can speed up puberty, with effects differing between boys and girls. Early onset puberty has been tied to serious health consequences later in life, including emotional stress and metabolic disorders. The findings could reshape dietary recommendations and encourage genetic screening to mitigate long-term risks.</description>

			<title>Bigger crops, fewer nutrients: The hidden cost of climate change</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250709091658.htm</link>
			<description>Climate change is silently sapping the nutrients from our food. A pioneering study finds that rising CO2 and higher temperatures are not only reshaping how crops grow but are also degrading their nutritional value especially in vital leafy greens like kale and spinach. This shift could spell trouble for global health, particularly in communities already facing nutritional stress. Researchers warn that while crops may grow faster, they may also become less nourishing, with fewer minerals, proteins, and antioxidants raising concerns about obesity, weakened immunity, and chronic diseases.</description>

			<title>Researchers tested 200 toddlers — 96 chemicals were lurking in their bodies</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250701234739.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers testing urine from 2- to 4-year-olds in four U.S. states uncovered 96 different chemicals, many of them unmonitored and linked to hormone and brain disruption. Legacy toxins like triclosan are slowly declining, yet replacements such as DINCH plasticizer and modern pesticides are rising. Toddlers—especially the youngest, later-born, and those from minority groups—often carried higher levels than their own mothers. Scientists urge expanded biomonitoring and stricter regulations before these invisible pollutants derail early development.</description>

			<title>Scientists just found a sugar switch that protects your brain from Alzheimer&#039;s</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250630073442.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have uncovered a surprising sugar-related mechanism inside brain cells that could transform how we fight Alzheimer’s and other dementias. It turns out neurons don’t just store sugar for fuel—they reroute it to power antioxidant defenses, but only if an enzyme called GlyP is active. When this sugar-clearing system is blocked, toxic tau protein builds up and accelerates brain degeneration.</description>

			<title>Acid-busting diet triggers 13-pound weight loss in just 16 weeks</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250626081532.htm</link>
			<description>Swap steaks for spinach and you might watch the scale plummet. In a 16-week crossover study, overweight adults who ditched animal products for a low-fat vegan menu saw their bodies become less acidic and dropped an average of 13 pounds—while the Mediterranean diet left weight unchanged. Researchers link the shift to lower “dietary acid load,” a hidden inflammation trigger driven by meat, eggs, and cheese.</description>

			<title>Myth-busting study shows controversial seed oils reduce inflammation</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250621103446.htm</link>
			<description>A new study is turning heads by challenging the popular belief that seed oils are harmful to health. Researchers analyzed blood markers from nearly 1,900 people and found that higher levels of linoleic acid — an omega-6 fat commonly found in seed oils — were linked to lower inflammation and better cardiometabolic health. The study used direct biomarkers instead of diet surveys, making its findings more robust. These results support a growing body of evidence that seed oils, far from fueling disease, may actually help protect against heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</description>

			<title>Diabetes drug cuts migraines in half by targeting brain pressure</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250620222132.htm</link>
			<description>A common diabetes drug may be the next big thing for migraine relief. In a clinical study, obese patients with chronic migraines who took liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, experienced over 50% fewer headache days and significantly improved daily functioning without meaningful weight loss. Researchers believe the drug s ability to lower brain fluid pressure is the key, potentially opening a completely new way to treat migraines. The effects were fast, sustained, and came with only mild side effects.</description>

			<title>The hunger switch in your nose: How smells tell your brain to stop eating</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250612031553.htm</link>
			<description>A team of scientists has discovered a direct link between the smell of food and feelings of fullness at least in lean mice. This brain circuit, located in the medial septum and triggered by food odors, helps animals eat less by making them feel satiated even before taking a bite. But intriguingly, obese mice lacked this response, highlighting how excess weight may interfere with this satiety mechanism. The finding could have major implications for how we think about the role of smell in appetite and offer new strategies to combat overeating.</description>

			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611084115.htm</link>
			<description>A team of scientists has identified specialized neurons in the brain that store &quot;meal memories&quot; detailed recollections of when and what we eat. These engrams, found in the ventral hippocampus, help regulate eating behavior by communicating with hunger-related areas of the brain. When these memory traces are impaired due to distraction, brain injury, or memory disorders individuals are more likely to overeat because they can&#039;t recall recent meals. The research not only uncovers a critical neural mechanism but also suggests new strategies for treating obesity by enhancing memory around food consumption.</description>

			<description>A popular fat found in olive oil may not be as innocent as it seems. Scientists discovered that oleic acid, a major component of many high-fat foods, uniquely spurs the growth of new fat cells by manipulating specific proteins in the body. Unlike other fats, it boosts the number of &quot;fat cell soldiers,&quot; setting the stage for obesity and possibly chronic diseases. This unexpected twist reveals that the type of fat we eat, not just how much, may play a crucial role in our health.</description>

			<title>Newly identified group of nerve cells in the brain regulates bodyweight</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250528132243.htm</link>
			<description>Obesity is a global health problem that affects many people. In recent years, very promising anti-obesity drugs have been developed. Despite these successes, there are patients who do not respond to these drugs or suffer from side effects. Therefore, there is still an unmet need for therapies. Researchers have now discovered a small group of nerve cells in the hypothalamus of mouse brains that influence eating behavior and weight gain. This discovery could pave the way for the development of new targeted anti-obesity drugs.</description>

			<description>The aging of the innermost cell layer of blood vessels leads to cardiovascular diseases. Researchers have now shown for the first time that intestinal bacteria and their metabolites contribute directly to vascular aging. As people age, the bacterial composition in their gut changes, resulting in fewer &#039;rejuvenating&#039; and more harmful substances in the body.</description>

			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250527124637.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers have found that central body fat, especially around the abdomen, is more strongly linked to psoriasis risk than total body fat, particularly in women. This link between central fat and psoriasis remained consistent regardless of genetic predisposition, indicating that abdominal fat is an independent risk factor. The study provides insights that could help improve early risk prediction and guide personalized prevention strategies.</description>

			<description>A leading cardiovascular disease researcher is ringing the alarm on universal recommendations intended to improve heart health around the globe. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with 80 per cent of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. However, international heart-health guidelines are primarily based on research from high-income countries and often overlook upstream causes of CVD, according to experts.</description>

			<description>If you&#039;ve ever regretted ordering a spicy meal, take note: A new study identifying molecules that suppress the heat of chili peppers hints at the possibility of adapting these compounds into an &#039;anti-spice&#039; condiment for food that&#039;s too fiery to eat. The research helps explain differences in chili pepper pungency, or spiciness, by identifying three compounds in a range of pepper samples that chemical analysis predicted, and study participants on a tasting panel confirmed, are linked to lower heat intensity.</description>

			<title>Unlocking the secrets of bat immunity</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250521124752.htm</link>
			<description>Bats are known as natural hosts for highly pathogenic viruses such as MERS- and SARS-related coronaviruses, as well as the Marburg and Nipah viruses. In contrast to the severe and often fatal disease outcomes these viruses cause in humans, bats generally do not show obvious signs of viral illness following infection. An international research team has developed an innovative organoid research platform that allowed them to closely investigate the cellular antiviral defense mechanisms of mucosal epithelial tissues of bats. The results could pave the way for the development of new therapies against viral diseases.</description>

			<description>Researchers have discovered a new way to reduce obesity. Supplying the gut with extra acetate reduces fat and liver mass in both normal and obese mice, as long as bacteria of the Bacteroides species is also present. When both these conditions are met, gut bacteria can eliminate more sugars from the gut and promote the burning of fats for energy in the host.</description>

			<description>Humans perceive and navigate the world around us with the help of our five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. And while scientists have long known that these different senses activate different parts of the brain, a new study indicates that multiple senses all stimulate a critical region deep in the brain that controls consciousness. The study sheds new light on how sensory perception works in the brain and may fuel the development of therapies to treat disorders involving attention, arousal, and consciousness.</description>
