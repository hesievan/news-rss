<title>Maximizing muscle deoxygenation during interval training in middle-distance runners</title>
<description><p>The present study aimed to investigate which of two commonly performed running interval sessions elicited the greatest magnitude of and time spent with elevated muscle deoxygenation in trained middle-distance runners. Thirteen trained middle-distance runners (22.4 ± 3.2 y; 63.1 ± 10.9&#xa0;kg; <i>n</i> = 9 males) participated in the study. Subjects completed a field-based incremental running test and two interval sessions. The interval sessions comprised a 6 × 1&#xa0;km and a 15 × 400&#xa0;m interval session, both with 1&#xa0;min passive recovery periods. Both sessions were implemented with the aim of achieving the maximal sustainable pace for each repetition, while mean speed, heart rate, RPE, blood lactate concentration and muscle deoxygenation responses were monitored. Mean speed during the interval repetitions was significantly higher during the 400&#xa0;m intervals (~ 5.63 ± 0.35&#xa0;m·s<sup>−1</sup> vs ~ 5.30 ± 0.28&#xa0;m·s<sup>−1</sup>; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Both the peak magnitude of muscle deoxygenation (absolute difference ± CI 3.42 ± 2.23%; <i>p</i> = 0.006) and the time spent with values &gt; 60% peak muscle deoxygenation (83.5 ± 66.4&#xa0;s; <i>p</i> = 0.02) were significantly greater during the 400&#xa0;m intervals, while the time spent with a heart rate &gt; 90% peak heart rate was significantly longer during the 1&#xa0;km interval session (570 ± 143, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Despite this, there was no difference in RPE, blood lactate concentration or peak heart rate between sessions. These findings suggest that 1&#xa0;km intervals may preferentially target central physiologic responses while 400&#xa0;m intervals may elicit greater peripheral physiological responses in trained middle-distance runners.</p></description>

<title>Examination of post-exercise microvascular reactivity in healthy adults</title>
<description>
              Aim
              <p>Skeletal muscle blood volume responds to the metabolic demands of exercise and augmented microvasculature reactivity. We sought to&#xa0;explore the effects of exercise intensity (maximal vs. submaximal) on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived blood volume and microvascular reactivity in the acute post-exercise timeframe.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>Healthy individuals (<i>N</i> = 18) between 18 and 35&#xa0;years completed a vascular occlusion test (VOT) followed by a maximal cycling test. A second VOT was performed 15-min post-exercise. One week later, the protocol was repeated before and after a submaximal bout of cycling (60% VO<sub>2</sub> peak). NIRS was used to assess total hemoglobin (tHb) (i.e., blood volume) before, during, and after exercise, as well as muscle oxygen consumption (mVO<sub>2</sub>) and microvascular reactivity (StO<sub>2</sub>% s<sup>−1</sup>) pre- and post-exercise.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Compared with pre-exercise, tHb was elevated at the end of exercise (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and remained elevated 15-min post-exercise (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) regardless of trial (combined means pre: 5.39 ± 0.82, during: 14.01 ± 1.73, and post-exercise: 10.89 ± 1.24 O.D.). mVO<sub>2</sub> was greater post-exercise in the max vs. submax trial (−&#xa0;0.36 ± 0.12 vs. −&#xa0;0.22 ± 0.11% s<sup>−1</sup>; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Compared with pre-exercise, microvascular reactivity was unchanged following the max trial (1.91 ± 0.61 vs. 1.71 ± 0.61% s<sup>−1</sup>; <i>p</i> = 0.079) but was greater following the submax trial (1.72 ± 0.43 vs. 1.98 ± 0.59; <i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Cycling at a submaximal, but not maximal, intensity results in augmented post-exercise microvascular reactivity, while post-exercise increases in skeletal muscle blood volume were found regardless of exercise intensity.</p>

<title>Time-variability of muscle oxygen saturation during graded maximal exercise</title>
<description><p>The time-variability of physiological and kinematic variables, extracted at mesoscopic and macroscopic levels, respectively, has shown potential in detecting changes in exercise workload and associated fatigue effects. However, the sensitivity of microscopic variables —such as muscle oxygen saturation, which reflect the dynamics of muscle metabolism—remains unexplored. This study aimed to compare the time-variability structure of the tissular saturation index (TSI) during a graded maximal exercise performed until exhaustion. Nineteen participants started running at 8&#xa0;km/h with the speed increasing by 1&#xa0;km/h every 100&#xa0;s until they could not keep the prescribed velocity. The time-variability of TSI, recorded from the quadriceps, was analyzed using Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and Sample entropy (SampEn) over the first and last 2048 recorded data points (corresponding to 204&#xa0;s each). Wilcoxon test and Cohen’s d were used to compare the initial and final parts of the test. Results revealed a significant decrease in the Hurst (H) exponent (from H = 0.84 ± 0.21 to H = 0.49 ± 0.10; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; <i>d</i> = -1.57) and a corresponding increase in SampEn (from 1.12 ± 0.20 to 1.40 ± 0.13; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; <i>d</i> = 1.17). These findings indicate a shift towards uncorrelated white-noise as exhaustion approached, suggesting reduced efficacy of oxygen transportation with increasing workloads. The time-variability of muscle oxygen saturation appears to be a) a promising measure for assessing exercise intensity, and b) allow the study of physiological network interactions extracted from different levels (from microscopic to macroscopic).</p></description>

<title>Investigating the effects of age and conditioning stimulation intensity on SMA–M1 connectivity in younger, middle-aged, and older adults</title>
<description>
              Purpose
              <p>This study aimed to investigate bilateral motor control and connectivity between supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) in younger, middle-aged, and older healthy adults.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>32 younger (mean age 22.8 ± 5.3&#xa0;years), 18 middle-aged (47.6 ± 6.5&#xa0;years), and 23 older (75.8 ± 6.7&#xa0;years) adults were tested. Bilateral motor control was assessed using the Purdue pegboard. Dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to measure SMA–M1 connectivity at different conditioning stimulation intensities.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Older adults had significantly poorer motor performance than younger and middle-aged in all pegboard subtests. Notably, there were no conclusive differences in motor performance between younger and middle-aged adults. There was no conclusive evidence supporting age-related and intensity-related differences in SMA–M1 connectivity between younger, middle-aged, and older adults. There was also no conclusive evidence to support clear associations between SMA–M1 connectivity and bilateral motor control.</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Age-related declines in bilateral motor functioning was found in older, but not middle-aged adults. The bilateral motor functioning of middle-aged adults is more young-like than old-like. The lack of conclusive age- and intensity-related differences in SMA–M1 connectivity, and lack of conclusive association with bilateral motor performance, might be due to high inter-individual variability in SMA–M1 connectivity. Potential factors contributing to this variability include SMA and M1 morphometry, the structural connectivity between these regions, and the localisation of SMA.</p>

<title>High-intensity exercise training mitigates post-exercise orthostatic hypotension in men</title>
<description><p>Whether high-intensity exercise training can effectively mitigate orthostatic-induced post-exercise hypotension (PEH) has not been satisfactory resolved to date. We therefore examined whether 2&#xa0;weeks of high-intensity exercise training can effectively mitigate the orthostatic-induced PEH by conducting comparisons pre- and post-training at the same absolute and relative workloads. Eleven healthy men underwent 2&#xa0;weeks of high-intensity exercise training within the severe intensity domain (i.e., above critical power) for 15&#xa0;min per session for 14 daily consecutive sessions. Assessment of orthostatic-induced PEH was conducted at pre- and post-training (both absolute and relative workloads) across seated and standing recovery postures. The exercise intensities for the PEH trials were conducted at 10% above critical power, followed by a 1-h recovery across seated and standing postures. Post-training, PEH assessment was performed at the same absolute and relative power output (i.e., 10% above the post-intervention critical power) as pre-training. Two weeks of high-intensity exercise training significantly increased $$\dot{V}$$O<sub>2max</sub>, resting ejection fraction, and fractional shortening velocity (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), thereby confirming an increased training status. Consequently, the reduction of systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures from baseline were smaller following 2&#xa0;weeks of high-intensity exercise training in both absolute and relative workloads during the recovery across seated and standing postures (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). We conclude that 2&#xa0;weeks of high-intensity exercise training was able to mitigate the orthostatic-induced PEH with both absolute and relative workloads in healthy Asian men.</p></description>

<title>Training in hot water immersion improved exercise performance in hot and humid conditions in recreational athletes – a randomized controlled trial</title>
<description>
              Background and objective
              <p>Heat acclimation is a common strategy for athlete preparing to compete in the heat. It is generally obtained by exercising in a hot environment, (e.g. environmental chambers) but passive exposure to hot water has also been shown to induce acclimation. Thus, combining exercise in hot water could be an innovative method to enhance performance in hot environments.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>In this prospective randomized controlled trial, two groups of 12 participants (22 males/2 females) underwent 10 aerobic training sessions on an underwater bike in either hot (35&#xa0;°C—hot water acclimation, HWA) or temperate (25&#xa0;°C, control, CON) water. Two to three days before and after intervention participants performed a 30-min time trial, in a hot and humid environment (T°: 38.4 ± 1.4&#xa0;°C, Relative Humidity: 45.3 ± 6.9%), as well as a cardiac echography, a blood analysis and a cardiopulmonary exercise test (V̇O<sub>2max</sub>) in temperate ambient conditions.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>The distance covered during the time trial in the heat increased depending on group (<i>p</i> = 0.024) with an increase of 1.1[+ 0.7, + 1.4]km in HWA (<i>p</i> &lt; .001) and 0.5[+ 0.1, + 0.8]km in CON (<i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
              <p>As well as power output (<i>p</i> = 0.096) improved more in the HWA vs. CON group (+ 27W in HWA and + 13W in CON). However, no difference between groups was observed regarding changes in physiological parameters during the time trial in the heat (core and skin temperature, sweat rate) or across the tests and measures in temperate environments (plasma volume, heart rate, V̇O<sub>2max</sub>).</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Exercise on a bike in hot water improves performance in hot and humid conditions but does not induce change physiological parameters in ambient conditions.</p>

<title>A question of rate? Girl-women differences in motor unit firing rate</title>
<description>
              Purpose
              <p>To investigate age-related differences in motor unit (MU) activation patterns in females during submaximal knee extensions.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>Fourteen young women (22.1 ± 1.5 yrs) and 10 girls (9.8 ± 0.8 yrs) participated in the study. Following the determination of maximal strength (MVC), participants completed trapezoidal isometric contractions to 70%MVC and sEMG was recorded from the vastus lateralis. sEMG signals were decomposed, and MU firing rate (MUFR) and recruitment threshold (RT) were calculated. Group differences in MU activation patterns were assessed using multilevel modelling.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Girls’ MVC was significantly lower than young women’s, even after accounting for body size (2.0 ± 0.4 and 2.6 ± 0.8&#xa0;Nm/body mass, respectively). The y-intercept of the MUFR-RT relationship was significantly lower in girls compared with the young women (estimate = 4.38pps; p &lt; 0.05). There were no group differences in the MUFR-RT slope, reflecting lower MUFR in girls among low and high-threshold MUs. Lastly, the highest RT at which MUs were identified was significantly (p = 0.04) lower in girls (53.4 ± 7.2%MVC) compared with young women (60.5 ± 8.2%MVC). Overall, girls had lower MUFR and recruited their MUs over a smaller range of RTs compared with women.</p>
            
              Conclusions
              <p>Together, these results suggest that girls and young women utilize different MU activation schemes when performing high-intensity knee extensions. Specifically, compared with women, girls may have to recruit more MUs over a narrower recruitment range due to their lower MUFRs.</p>

<title>Does the terrain influence running critical power and biomechanics? An in-field study with highly trained trail runners</title>
<description><p>This study aimed to assess the effects of three flat running surfaces (i.e. athletic track, road, and gravel) on the critical power (CP) parameters and running patterns of highly trained trail runners. Within a two-week timeframe, thirteen male and seven female trail runners underwent three testing sessions to evaluate CP and the work over CP (<i>W</i>’). Each session comprised two time trials of 9 and 3 minutes, separated by a 30-min rest, in which a Stryd running power meter was used to collect the data. The CP and <i>W</i>’ were subsequently determined using the inverse of time linear CP model. There were no significant differences in CP across the different surfaces (<i>F</i><sub>(2,38)</sub>= 1.4; <i>p</i> = 0.253). However, significant differences were found in <i>W</i>’ (<i>F</i><sub>(2,38)</sub>= 3.8; <i>p</i> = 0.032). Specifically, athletes displayed a higher <i>W</i>’ on the track compared to gravel (1.8 [0.2 to 3.4] kJ, <i>p =</i> 0.026), and higher, though non-significant, <i>W</i>’ on the road compared to gravel (0.9 [−0.7 to 2.5] kJ, <i>p</i> = 0.478). Regarding the running patterns, the athletes displayed lower duty factor on the track compared to gravel (−1.1 [−2.2 to −0.1] %; <i>p</i> = 0.030) as well as on the road compared to gravel (−1.1 [−2.0 to −0.1] %; <i>p =</i> 0.019). In conclusion, the CP remained stable across surfaces, whereas W’ was reduced on gravel compared to track and road. The differences in W’ were accompanied by significant changes in the athletes’ running patterns. Specifically, athletes exhibited a lower duty factor on the track and road compared to gravel, resulting in a more aerial running form.</p></description>

<title>Effects of thigh muscle activity patterns on blood pressure and edema during interrupted sitting in overweight and obese men</title>
<description>
              Purpose
              <p>This study compared the effects of different muscle activity patterns on blood pressure and lower leg edema during interrupted sitting in overweight and obese men.</p>
            
              Design
              <p>Randomized four-arm cross-over experimental study.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>Eighteen overweight and obese men (21.0 ± 1.2 years; 28.8 ± 2.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) took part. The four interventions were uninterrupted sitting for 8.5 h (SIT) and interruptions in sitting with 30-min walking at 4 km/h (ONE), sitting with 3-min walking at 4 km/h (WALK) or squatting (SQUAT) every 45 min for 10 times. Blood pressure was measured every 45 min. Lower leg volume was measured using water displacement method at the beginning and immediately after the experiment to examine lower leg edema. Thigh muscle electromyogram (EMG) amplitude and EMG activity duration were used to predict the effects on blood pressure and lower leg edema in generalized linear mixed effects models.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 2.54 mmHg (95% CI − 4.47 to − 0.62, <i>P</i> = 0.010) in WALK relative to SIT. The changes of lower leg volumes were reduced by 70.34 ml (− 112.78 to − 27.91, <i>P</i> = 0.002) in WALK and 62.49 ml (− 104.92 to − 20.06, <i>P</i> = 0.005) in SQUAT relative to SIT. Increased thigh muscle EMG amplitude was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (− 1.02 mmHg [− 1.79 to − 0.25], <i>P</i> = 0.010). Longer EMG activity duration was associated with decreased lower leg edema (− 1.02 ml [− 1.83 to − 0.21], <i>P</i> = 0.015).</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Frequent interruptions to prolonged sitting confer distinct health benefits through specific muscle activity patterns, providing potential targets for interventions.</p>

<title>Mental fatigue accompanied by whole-body surface cooling is associated with the impairment of subsequent endurance exercise performance</title>
<description>
              Purpose
              <p>To investigate whether mental fatigue induced by psychological tasks during whole-body surface cooling influences subsequent endurance exercise performance and whether subjective fatigue is associated with performance variability and neuroendocrine responses.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>Nine young adults participated in two trials: a mental stress (MS) trial involving the Stroop test (500 stimuli/set × 2) and a control (CON) trial involving watching a video. Both were conducted during whole-body surface cooling using a water-perfused suit (10&#xa0;°C, 10&#xa0;min, then 15&#xa0;°C, 85&#xa0;min). The time to exhaustion (TE) during cycling at 80% peak oxygen uptake was evaluated. Chalder’s fatigue score (CFS), plasma adrenaline ([Ad]<sub>p</sub>), noradrenaline ([Norad]<sub>p</sub>), and cortisol ([Corti]<sub>p</sub>) concentrations were measured before and after intervention and exercise.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>After the intervention, the CFS increased in the MS trial, but not in the CON trial. [Ad]<sub>p</sub> and [Norad]<sub>p</sub> remained unchanged after the intervention and increased after exercise in both trials, and an increase with exercise was prominent in the MS trial. [Corti]<sub>p</sub> remained unchanged. TE decreased by 5.7% in the MS trial. However, this was not statistically significant. The difference (Δ) in TE between trials was significantly negatively correlated with ΔCFS (<i>r</i> = −&#xa0;0.919, <i>P</i> = 0.002). ΔCFS was significantly positively correlated with Δ[Norad]<sub>p</sub> (<i>r</i> = 0.795, <i>P</i> = 0.010), while not with [Ad]<sub>p</sub> or [Corti]<sub>p</sub>.</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Mental fatigue accompanied by whole-body surface cooling variably influences subsequent endurance exercise performance with decrements associated with greater subjective fatigue and heightened sympathoadrenal–medullary activity though trial-level effects were not significant. There was no apparent hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis involvement.</p>

<title>People with down syndrome exhibit a blunted hemodynamic response to isometric handgrip but not cycling exercise</title>
<description><p>People with Down syndrome (DS) have a depressed heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) response to exercise. We tested the hypothesis that people with DS, compared to controls (CON), would have more blunted HR and BP responses to isometric rather than dynamic cycling exercise. Twenty-eight individuals with DS and 14 controls (16–40&#xa0;years) completed a 6-min cycling exercise at 50% body weight and 2-min handgrip isometric exercise at 30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). HR and BP were sampled via a single-lead system and finger photoplethysmography, respectively. Hemodynamic responses to both exercises were tested with linear mixed models. Individuals with DS showed a blunted HR increase to handgrip (DS: difference (d)<sub>60s-rest </sub>= 3, 95% CI: −10 to 4&#xa0;bpm, <i>p</i> = 0.989; CON: d<sub>60s-rest</sub> = 16, 95%CI: 6 to 26&#xa0;bpm, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not cycling exercise (DS: d<sub>60-rest</sub> = 21, 95%CI: 6 to 26&#xa0;bpm, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Exercise-induced increases in mean arterial pressure were smaller in people with DS during handgrip (DS: d<sub>60s-rest</sub> = 7, 95% CI: 3–12&#xa0;mmHg, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; CON: d<sub>60s-rest</sub> = 15, 95% CI: 12 to 22&#xa0;mmHg, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not during cycling exercise (DS: d<sub>60s-rest</sub> = 13, 95% CI: 7 to 18&#xa0;mmHg, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; CON: d<sub>60s-rest </sub>= 8, 95% CI:1 to 16&#xa0;mmHg). Controlling for group differences in resting BP, fitness, %peak HR and MVC did not change results. People with DS exhibited a blunted hemodynamic response to isometric, but not dynamic cycling exercise, suggesting that HR and BP control differ between these two exercise modes in this population.</p></description>

<title>Bovine colostrum supplementation in rugby</title>
<description>
              Introduction
              <p>Bovine colostrum is a nutrient-dense first milk, rich in bioactive compounds such as immunoglobulins and growth factors, which may enhance athletic performance and immune function. Rugby union involves high-intensity training for both aerobic and muscular power, which could leave athletes vulnerable to opportunistic infections.</p>
            
              Purpose
              <p>This double-blind, randomized study examined the effects of 8&#xa0;weeks of bovine colostrum supplementation (38&#xa0;g/day) versus soy protein in 29 club-level rugby players (three women) during the competitive season.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>Muscular strength (1RM bench and leg press) and power (vertical jump), aerobic power (20&#xa0;m shuttle run), body composition (DXA and ultrasound), and salivary immune and inflammatory markers (IgA, CRP, IL-6, IL-1β) were assessed at baseline and after 8&#xa0;weeks of supplementation.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Bovine colostrum supplementation significantly improved vertical jump height (+ 1.0&#xa0;cm in the colostrum group; −&#xa0;0.5&#xa0;cm in the soy group; <i>p</i> = 0.0023), indicating enhanced lower body power. No significant changes were observed for upper (<i>p</i> = 0.38) or lower (<i>p</i> = 0.82) body strength, aerobic power (<i>p</i> = 0.16), body composition measures (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05), or salivary immune and inflammatory markers (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05) compared to the soy group. Reported incidences of illness were unaffected by bovine colostrum supplementation.</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Bovine colostrum may enhance neuromuscular performance, specifically lower body power, but provides limited benefits for other performance metrics, body composition, or immune/inflammatory function. Future research should explore bovine colostrum’s potential during off-season training or under higher immune stress conditions.</p>

<title>Caffeine intake reverses the impairment of sleep restriction on high-intensity exercise performance</title>
<description><p>We investigated whether caffeine ingestion reverses the deleterious effect of sleep restriction on high-intensity exercise (HIE) performance, and its impact on ventilatory, blood acidosis, and neuromuscular fatigue. Nine physically active men (29 ± 6&#xa0;years, 176 ± 5&#xa0;cm, 80.4 ± 7.4&#xa0;kg) completed a session of HIE under: (1) habitual sleep plus placebo ingestion (HSP); (2) sleep restriction plus placebo ingestion (SRP); and (3) sleep restriction plus 5&#xa0;mg.kg<sup>−1</sup> of caffeine ingestion (SRC). Ventilatory responses were continually monitored, while blood H<sup>+</sup>, plasma lactate, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), voluntary activation (VA), and quadriceps potentiated doublet-twitch force (PT) were assessed at pre-capsule ingestion, after completing 70% of the HIE, and at task failure. Time to task failure was shorter (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in SRP (6.23 ± 2.11 min) than in HSP (7.68 ± 2.92 min) and SRC (7.83 ± 3.19 min), without differences between HSP and SRC (<i>p</i> = 0.96). Sleep restriction reduced minute ventilation (~6%) and tidal volume (~7%) and increased respiratory frequency (~5%) near to the end of HIE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); caffeine ingestion, however, reverted these effects of sleep restriction. Blood H<sup>+</sup> was higher (~34%) and plasma lactate lower (~21%) at post-exercise in SRP than in HSP and SRC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), but similar between HSP and SRC (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). The VA decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) from pre- to post-exercise in SRP (4 ± 5%), but not in HSP and SRC (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). The MVIC and PT decreased similarly from pre- to post-exercise in all conditions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Caffeine ingestion reverses the impairment of sleep restriction on HIE performance, likely by restoring normal ventilatory pattern and preventing sleep restriction-induced exacerbated acidosis and central fatigue.</p></description>

<title>Heavy strength training effects on physiological determinants of endurance cyclist performance: a systematic review with meta-analysis</title>
<description>
              Background
              <p>Endurance cycling performance is determined by maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max), maximal metabolic steady state (MMSS), non-oxidative energy contribution (i.e., anaerobic capacity and anaerobic power) and cycling efficiency and power related to VO<sub>2</sub>max (pVO<sub>2</sub>max). Strength training can improve these variables. However, is yet to be clarified the effects of heavy strength training (≥ 80% of one repetition maximum).</p>
            
              Aim
              <p>The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to analyse heavy strength training effects on physiological determinants of endurance cyclists’ performance.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus including articles indexed up to February 2025. Following the PICOS criteria: Population, endurance cyclists aged ≥ 18 years or older, without restriction of sex or performance level; Intervention, heavy strength training (≥ 3 weeks); Comparator, group that performed cycling endurance training without receiving heavy strength training; Outcome, physiological determinants of endurance cycling (i.e., VO<sub>2</sub>max, pVO<sub>2</sub>max, MMSS, cycling efficiency, anaerobic capacity, and anaerobic power) and/or cycling performance (i.e., time to exhaustion and time trial [combined for analyses]), measured before and after the intervention and; Study design, randomised and non-randomised controlled studies. Risk of bias in studies was assessed (PEDro), and certainty of evidence at the outcome level (GRADE). Random-effects meta-analyses (for VO<sub>2</sub>max, pVO<sub>2</sub>max, MMSS, anaerobic capacity, anaerobic power and cycling performance), three-level random-effects meta-analyses (for cycling efficiency) and moderator analyses (i.e., participant and intervention characteristics) were conducted. Significance was set as <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Included studies (n = 17) comprised 262 participants (60 female) with a mean initial VO<sub>2</sub>max level of 61.25 ml/kg/min, with interventions lasting between 5 and 25 weeks, with 1–3 sessions per week. Compared to controls, heavy strength training showed a significant effect on cycling efficiency (effect size [ES] = 0.353, <i>p</i> = 0.012, LRT<sub>level2; level3</sub> = 1), anaerobic power (ES = 0.560, <i>p</i> = 0.024, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 29.100) and cycling performance (ES = 0.463, <i>p</i> = 0.016, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001), with no significant effect on VO<sub>2</sub>max, pVO<sub>2</sub>max, MMSS, and anaerobic capacity (all <i>p</i> ≥ 0.263, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001). No significant moderating effect was found for participant characteristics (i.e., sex, body mass, height, performance level, and strength training experience) or intervention characteristics (i.e., duration, training frequency, total sessions) (all <i>p</i> ≥ 0.170). Results presented low certainty of evidence.</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Heavy strength training can improve cycling performance (i.e., time to exhaustion; time trial) in endurance cyclist. This improvement may be mainly due to an improvement in cycling efficiency and anaerobic power. These results occur without changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max, pVO<sub>2</sub>max, MMSS or anaerobic capacity. Nonetheless, the low certainty of evidence precludes robust recommendations regarding optimal implementation of heavy strength training.</p>

<title>Examination of neuromuscular and tissue oxygenation characteristics during submaximal treadmill running with blood flow restriction</title>
<description>
              Purpose
              <p>The use of blood flow restricted (BFR) running may provide an alternative to lower the running speed without compromising physiological responses that often occur during high intensity running. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the acute effects of various submaximal treadmill running speeds with BFR relative to maximal treadmill running speed without BFR on surface electromyographic amplitude (sEMG<sub>AMP</sub>), surface electromyographic mean power frequency (sEMG<sub>MPF</sub>), and muscle tissue oxygenation (StO<sub>2</sub>) responses.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>Thirteen college-aged females randomly completed four, three-minute treadmill running bouts at 70%, 80%, and 90% of their top speed (achieved during a graded exercise test) with BFR (70%<sub>BFR</sub>, 80%<sub>BFR</sub>, and 90%<sub>BFR</sub>) and 100% of their top speed without BFR (100%<sub>NOBFR</sub>). The sEMG<sub>AMP</sub>, sEMG<sub>MPF</sub>, and StO<sub>2</sub> responses were analyzed from the final minute of the treadmill running bouts.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Each treadmill running bout led to similar (zero present in each Bayesian 95% high-density interval) sEMG<sub>AMP</sub>, sEMG<sub>MPF</sub>, and StO<sub>2</sub> responses (70%<sub>BFR</sub> = 80%<sub>BFR</sub> = 90%<sub>BFR</sub> = 100%<sub>NOBFR</sub>). The mean difference (Mean<sub>diff</sub>) between speeds ranged from 2.73% to 11.20% for sEMG<sub>AMP</sub>, 0.04% to 7.08% for sEMG<sub>MPF</sub>, and 0.02% to 1.03% for StO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Despite reductions in treadmill running speed, sEMG<sub>AMP</sub>, sEMG<sub>MPF</sub>, and StO<sub>2</sub> responses were similar among non-BFR maximal treadmill running and submaximal treadmill running with BFR. Thus, submaximal treadmill running with BFR may serve as a potential alternative when maximal intensity aerobic exercise is contraindicated.</p>

<title>Ground gradient affects stride-to-stride fluctuations and gait variability in overground walking</title>
<description>
              Purpose
              <p>This study aims to explore the impact of ground gradient on gait variability.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>Ten healthy adults (39.3 ± 4.14&#xa0;years) performed overground walking under three gradient conditions: uphill 10.1° (17.81%), −&#xa0;10.1° downhill (−&#xa0;17.81%), and level 0.54° (0.95%). Gait kinematics were recorded using inertial measurement units, and stride time intervals were evaluated for variability magnitude and temporal structure via Coefficient of Variation (CV) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA-α). Heart rate was recorded and served as a measure of exertion.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Significant differences in both CV and DFA-α emerged among conditions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Downhill walking exhibited the highest CV (4.67 ± 1.65%) and the lowest DFA-α (0.62 ± 0.13). In contrast, uphill walking showed intermediate values (CV: 3.67 ± 0.84%; DFA-α: 0.76 ± 0.09), while level walking displayed the lowest CV (1.98 ± 0.62%) and the highest DFA-α (0.84 ± 0.1), demonstrating a parabolic effect of ground gradient with gait variability for both CV and DFA-α. Downhill walking also elicited faster average velocities (1.57 ± 0.14&#xa0;m/s) compared to uphill (1.38 ± 0.09&#xa0;m/s) and level (1.46 ± 0.08&#xa0;m/s) walking.</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>Interestingly, while uphill walking resulted in the highest heart rate (141.9 ± 13.8&#xa0;bpm), DFA-α values of stride time intervals time series did not differ significantly from level walking, suggesting that metabolic effort may not be associated with the temporal structure of gait variability. Overall, it appears that during downhill walking, pronounced neuro-mechanical demands, likely imposed by eccentric effort, affect the amount and temporal structure of variability.</p>

<title>The impact of pole use on vertical cost of transport and foot force during uphill treadmill walking before and after a simulated trail running competition</title>
<description>
              Purpose
              <p>Trail running poles are widely used among trail runners but their effects on cost of transport and biomechanics under fatigued conditions remains understudied. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of pole use on the walking vertical cost of transport (CoT<sub>vert</sub>) and foot force (FF) before and after a simulated trail running competition (STRC).</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>Sixteen trail runners ($${\dot{\text{V}}\text{O}}_{{2}}$$: 61.0 ± 8.3&#xa0;ml/kg/min; ITRA performance index: 634 ± 107 points) performed walking trials with (PW) and without poles (CW) on an incline treadmill (18.6 degrees) before (PRE) and after (POST) a STRC. The course covered 31.2&#xa0;km with 2086&#xa0;m of elevation gain and was completed under race-simulated conditions. CoT<sub>vert</sub> and FF were measured using instrumented insoles, and axial pole force was recorded during PW.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>The STRC was completed in 4:25:33 ± 0:39:51 (hh:mm:ss) at an average heart rate (HR) of 81.4 ± 3.8% of HRmax. Walking CoT<sub>vert</sub> showed significant <i>time</i> and <i>condition</i> effects, with higher values without poles at POST (+ 2.50 ± 2.62%, <i>p</i> = 0.0183). Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was lower with poles at both PRE and POST (<i>p</i> = 0.0022 and <i>p</i> = 0.0187, respectively). FF was significantly lower with poles at PRE (<i>p</i> = 0.0140) and POST (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Poling force decreased at POST compared to PRE (<i>p</i> = 0.0026).</p>
            
              Conclusions
              <p>The main findings are that (1) CoT<sub>vert</sub> increases after STRC; (2) walking CoT<sub>vert</sub> and FF are lower with pole use and&#xa0;(3) upper limb force decreases at POST. These results support the use of poles in long-lasting events to reduce CoT, redistribute workload and possibly mitigate the fatigue effects.</p>

<title>Countermovement jump performance after metabolically, but not mechanically demanding exercise: limited sensitivity to prolonged low-frequency force depression</title>
<description>
              Rationale
              <p>Previous studies indicate that countermovement jump (CMJ) parameters may reflect neuromuscular fatigue following exhaustive exercise. However, changes in CMJ performance in response to non-muscle damaging exercise, and its relation to prolonged low-frequency force depression (PLFFD) is yet unknown.</p>
            
              Purpose
              <p>This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between&#xa0;PLFFD and CMJ test parameters following exhaustive cycling exercise to task failure.</p>
            
              Methods
              <p>A sample of 11 recreationally active adults completed an incremental cycling protocol to task failure. CMJ performance, low-frequency (10&#xa0;Hz) force, and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force output were assessed at baseline (pre-exercise), immediately after task failure (0&#xa0;min), and at 8&#xa0;min, 15&#xa0;min, 60&#xa0;min, 24&#xa0;h, and 48&#xa0;h post-task failure. PLFFD was assessed as the ratio of 10&#xa0;Hz to MVC force.</p>
            
              Results
              <p>Compared to baseline, PLFFD was larger from 0&#xa0;min (7.4%) to 60-min (6.7%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.002). In contrast, no substantial changes in CMJ parameters were observed, except for a reduced concentric impulse (ConImp) lasting 8&#xa0;min post-exercise.</p>
            
              Conclusion
              <p>The results show that CMJ parameters remain unchanged following non-eccentrically loaded exhaustive exercise, while PLFFD is significantly higher for up to 60&#xa0;min post-exercise. This raises questions about the utility of CMJ as a fatigue assessment tool in athletic populations. This suggests that CMJ testing may not effectively detect the presence of PLFFD following non-muscle damaging exercise and future research should explore alternative measures for monitoring neuromuscular fatigue in training contexts.</p>
