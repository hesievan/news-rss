Epidemiological and interventional investigations have suggested a link between sleep deprivation and overweight/obesity. Sleep deprivation affects homeostatic and non-homoeostatic regulation of appetite, with the food reward system playing a dominant role. Factors such as sex and weight status affect this regulation; men and individuals with excess weight seem to be more sensitive to reward-driven and hedonistic regulation of food intake. Sleep deprivation may also affect weight through affecting physical activity and energy expenditure. In addition, sleep deprivation influences food selection and eating behaviours, which are mainly managed by the food reward system. Sleep-deprived individuals mostly crave for palatable energy-dense foods and have low desire for fruit and vegetables. Consumption of meals may not change but energy intake from snacks increases. The individuals have more desire for snacks with high sugar and saturated fat content. The relationship between sleep and the diet is mutual, implying that diet and eating behaviours also affect sleep duration and quality. Consuming healthy diets containing fruit and vegetables and food sources of protein and unsaturated fats and low quantities of saturated fat and sugar may be used as a diet strategy to improve sleep. Since the effects of sleep deficiency differ between animals and humans, only evidence from human subject studies has been included, controversies are discussed and the need for future investigations is highlighted.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422423000264?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422423000264</dc:identifier><dc:title>Sleep deprivation in development of obesity, effects on appetite regulation, energy metabolism, and dietary choices</dc:title><prism:startingPage>4</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>24</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422423000264</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422423000264?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2023-10-31</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2023-10-31</dc:date><dc:creator>Akhlaghi, Masoumeh</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kohanmoo, Ali</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422423000276?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Nutritional considerations in major depressive disorder: current evidence and functional testing for clinical practice]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Depression is a multifaceted condition with diverse underlying causes. Several contributing and inter-related factors such as genetic, nutritional, neurological, physiological, gut-brain-axis, metabolic and psychological stress factors play a role in the pathophysiology of depression. This review aims to highlight the role that nutritional factors play in the aetiology of depression. Secondly, we discuss the biomedical and functional pathology tests which measure these factors, and the current evidence supporting their use. Lastly, we make recommendations on how practitioners can incorporate the latest evidence-based research findings into clinical practice. This review highlights that diet and nutrition greatly affect the pathophysiology of depression. Nutrients influence gene expression, with folate and vitamin B12 playing vital roles in methylation reactions and homocysteine regulation. Nutrients are also involved in the tryptophan/kynurenine pathway and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Additionally, diet influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response and the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, both of which have been implicated in depression. A comprehensive dietary assessment, combined with appropriate evaluation of biochemistry and blood pathology, may help uncover contributing factors to depressive symptoms. By employing such an approach, a more targeted and personalised treatment strategy can be devised, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422423000276?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422423000276</dc:identifier><dc:title>Nutritional considerations in major depressive disorder: current evidence and functional testing for clinical practice</dc:title><prism:startingPage>25</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>36</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422423000276</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422423000276?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2023-11-15</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2023-11-15</dc:date><dc:creator>Khiroya, Kathryn</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sekyere, Eric</dc:creator><dc:creator>McEwen, Bradley</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bayes, Jessica</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000076?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[An overview of nutritional factors in the aetiopathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis in great apes]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="graphical"><p style="float: left;"><img class='graphic' orientation='' mimeSubtype='png' mimetype='image' position='float' type='' href='S0954422424000076_figAb.png' src='http://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS0954422424000076/resource/name/S0954422424000076_figAb.png?pub-status=live'/></p></div><div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>The main cause of mortality in great apes in zoological settings is cardiovascular disease (CVD), affecting all four taxa: chimpanzee (<span class='italic'>Pan troglodytes</span>), bonobo (<span class='italic'>Pan paniscus</span>), gorilla (<span class='italic'>Gorilla</span> spp.) and orangutan (<span class='italic'>Pongo</span> spp.). Myocardial fibrosis, the most typical histological characterisation of CVD in great apes, is non-specific, making it challenging to understand the aetiopathogenesis. A multifactorial origin of disease is assumed whereby many potential causative factors are directly or indirectly related to the diet, which in wild-living great apes mainly consists of high-fibre, low-carbohydrate and very low-sodium components. Diets of great apes housed in zoological settings are often different compared with the situation in the wild. Moreover, low circulating vitamin D levels have recently been recognised in great apes housed in more northern regions. Evaluation of current supplementation guidelines shows that, despite implementation of different dietary strategies, animals stay vitamin D insufficient. Therefore, recent hypotheses designate vitamin D deficiency as a potential underlying factor in the pathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis. The aim of this literature review is to: (i) examine important differences in nutritional factors between zoological and wild great ape populations; (ii) explain the potential detrimental effects of the highlighted dietary discrepancies on cardiovascular function in great apes; and (iii) elucidate specific nutrition-related pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie the development of myocardial fibrosis. This information may contribute to understanding the aetiopathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis in great apes and pave the way for future clinical studies and a more preventive approach to great ape CVD management.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000076?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000076</dc:identifier><dc:title>An overview of nutritional factors in the aetiopathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis in great apes</dc:title><prism:startingPage>37</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>52</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000076</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000076?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-02-12</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-02-12</dc:date><dc:creator>Van Mulders, Laurens</dc:creator><dc:creator>Locquet, Laurent</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kaandorp, Christine</dc:creator><dc:creator>Janssens, Geert P.

However, university students are at risk of developing poor eating habits due to various factors, including economic conditions, academic stress and lack of information about nutritional concepts. Poor diet quality leads to malnutrition or overnutrition, increasing the risk of preventable diseases. Food environments on university campuses also play a significant role in shaping the dietary habits of students, with the availability of and accessibility to healthy food options being important factors influencing food choices and overall diet quality. Disordered eating habits and body dissatisfaction are prevalent among university students and can lead to eating disorders. Income and living arrangements also influence dietary habits, with low household income and living alone being associated with unhealthy eating habits. This study is a narrative review that aimed to address nutritional issues and eating behaviours, specifically among university students. We investigated the eating behaviours of university students, including their dietary patterns, food choices and food environments. The objective of this review was to provide insights into the nutritional issues and eating behaviours of university students, with the aim of identifying target areas for intervention to improve the overall health and wellbeing among college students. University food environments need to be restructured to promote healthy eating, including the availability, accessibility, affordability and labelling of healthy foods, and policies to limit the availability of unhealthy foods and drinks on campus.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000088?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000088</dc:identifier><dc:title>Addressing nutritional issues and eating behaviours among university students: a narrative review</dc:title><prism:startingPage>53</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>68</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000088</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000088?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-02-15</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-02-15</dc:date><dc:creator>Almoraie, Noha M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Alothmani, Noor M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Alomari, Wajd D.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Al-amoudi, Amal H.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242400009X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Current perspectives and challenges in the estimation of fruit juice consumption across the lifecycle in Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Fruit juice (FJ) is typically low in energy, contains natural sugars, important amounts of micronutrients and is not permitted to have added sugars/sweeteners. However, its role in a healthy diet is under scrutiny partly due to the wider adoption of the definition for free sugars in nutrition policy. This review aimed to identify data on FJ consumption from national food consumption surveys across Europe, to examine current intakes, percent consumers and its contribution to intakes of energy, total sugars, free sugars, vitamin C, folate and potassium. Data were extracted on the population mean intake of FJ and its contribution to nutrient intakes across the lifecycle and crude estimates of population mean intakes across countries were reported for the total population and for consumers only. This review highlighted significant gaps/challenges regarding the availability of country-specific national food consumption surveys across Europe and specifically data on FJ consumption (including complexities surrounding categorisations). Nonetheless, using a comparable/homogenous definition, the mean intake of FJ among consumers was approximately 1 × 150 ml glass/day for adults/older adults, with lower intakes among infants (86 g/d), children (108 g/d) and teenagers (112 g/d). FJ made important contributions to intakes of vitamin C while making little contribution to energy intakes but also contributed 2–14 % of free sugars intake (which may be considered modest compared to other sources). The complexity of collating and interpreting data on FJ intake as elucidated in this review raises questions surrounding the categorisation of FJ in research and presents significant challenges for policymakers with respect to dietary guidance for FJ.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242400009X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S095442242400009X</dc:identifier><dc:title>Current perspectives and challenges in the estimation of fruit juice consumption across the lifecycle in Europe</dc:title><prism:startingPage>69</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>80</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S095442242400009X</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242400009X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-02-15</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-02-15</dc:date><dc:creator>Walton, Janette</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kehoe, Laura</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422423000288?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Dietary assessment methods for measurement of oral intake in acute care and critically ill hospitalised patients: a scoping review]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Quantification of oral intake within the hospital setting is required to guide nutrition care. Multiple dietary assessment methods are available, yet details regarding their application in the acute care setting are scarce. This scoping review, conducted in accordance with JBI methodology, describes dietary assessment methods used to measure oral intake in acute and critical care hospital patients. The search was run across four databases to identify primary research conducted in adult acute or critical care settings from 1st of January 2000-15th March 2023 which quantified oral diet with any dietary assessment method. In total, 155 articles were included, predominantly from the acute care setting (<span class='italic'>n</span> = 153, 99%). Studies were mainly single-centre (<span class='italic'>n</span> = 138, 88%) and of observational design (<span class='italic'>n</span> = 135, 87%). Estimated plate waste (<span class='italic'>n</span> = 59, 38%) and food records (<span class='italic'>n</span> = 43, 28%) were the most frequent assessment methods with energy and protein the main nutrients quantified (<span class='italic'>n</span> = 81, 52%). Validation was completed in 23 (15%) studies, with the majority of these using a reference method reliant on estimation (<span class='italic'>n</span> = 17, 74%). A quarter of studies (<span class='italic'>n</span> = 39) quantified completion (either as complete versus incomplete or degree of completeness) and four studies (2.5%) explored factors influencing completion. Findings indicate a lack of high-quality evidence to guide selection and application of existing dietary assessment methods to quantify oral intake with a particular absence of evidence in the critical care setting. Further validation of existing tools and identification of factors influencing completion is needed to guide the optimal approach to quantification of oral intake in both research and clinical contexts.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422423000288?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422423000288</dc:identifier><dc:title>Dietary assessment methods for measurement of oral intake in acute care and critically ill hospitalised patients: a scoping review</dc:title><prism:startingPage>81</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>94</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422423000288</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422423000288?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2023-12-11</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2023-12-11</dc:date><dc:creator>Ferguson, Clare E.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tatucu-Babet, Oana A.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Amon, Jenna N.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chapple, Lee-anne S.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Malacria, Lauren</dc:creator><dc:creator>Myint Htoo, Ivy</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hodgson, Carol L.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ridley, Emma J.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242300029X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Effect of tomato, tomato-derived products and lycopene on metabolic inflammation: from epidemiological data to molecular mechanisms]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>The goal of this narrative review is to summarise the current knowledge and limitations related to the anti-inflammatory effects of tomato, tomato-derived products and lycopene in the context of metabolic inflammation associated to cardiometabolic diseases.

From epidemiological to mechanistic studies, this review aims to identify limitations of the current knowledge and gaps that remain to be filled to improve our comprehension in contrasted anti-inflammatory effects of tomato, tomato-derived products and pure lycopene.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242300029X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S095442242300029X</dc:identifier><dc:title>Effect of tomato, tomato-derived products and lycopene on metabolic inflammation: from epidemiological data to molecular mechanisms</dc:title><prism:startingPage>95</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>111</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S095442242300029X</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242300029X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2023-12-18</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2023-12-18</dc:date><dc:creator>Landrier, Jean-François</dc:creator><dc:creator>Breniere, Thomas</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sani, Léa</dc:creator><dc:creator>Desmarchelier, Charles</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mounien, Lourdes</dc:creator><dc:creator>Borel, Patrick</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000052?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Programmes to manage food selectivity in individuals with autism spectrum disorder]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="graphical"><p style="float: left;"><img class='graphic' orientation='' mimeSubtype='png' mimetype='image' position='float' type='' href='S0954422424000052_figAb.png' src='http://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS0954422424000052/resource/name/S0954422424000052_figAb.png?pub-status=live'/></p></div><div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by impaired social communication and restricted interests/repetitive behaviours. In this regard, sensory processing difficulties and delayed oral motor skills often predispose individuals with ASD to food selectivity (FS). It is usually associated with repetitive eating patterns that can lead to multiple malnutrition conditions. The objective of this narrative review is to present an overview about the existing nutritional interventions aiming at promoting a healthy eating pattern and addressing food selectivity among individuals with ASD. Regarding the interventions targeting nutrition education, the majority of the analysed studies failed to demonstrate their effectiveness. On the other hand, many educational interventions involving taste or cooking sessions, as well as behavioural interventions for FS, demonstrated effective results. Moreover, multidisciplinary in tailoring such programmes, including psychology speech therapy and nutritional skills, is acknowledged as a key approach.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000052?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000052</dc:identifier><dc:title>Programmes to manage food selectivity in individuals with autism spectrum disorder</dc:title><prism:startingPage>112</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>125</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000052</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000052?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-02-22</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-02-22</dc:date><dc:creator>Breda, Chiara</dc:creator><dc:creator>Santero, Sara</dc:creator><dc:creator>Conti, Maria Vittoria</dc:creator><dc:creator>Cena, Hellas</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000027?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Food portion sizes: trends and drivers in an obesogenic environment]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults has increased worldwide. A strong environmental factor contributing to the obesity epidemic is food portion size (PS). This review evaluates the current evidence linking food PS to obesity, examines the effects of PS on energy intake (EI), and discusses the drivers of food PS selection. The leading causes of the rise in PS include globalisation, intensive farming methods, the impact of World War II, due to shortage of staple foods, and the notion of ‘waste not, want not’. Large PS of energy-dense foods may stimulate overconsumption, leading to high EI levels. However, the studies have not shown a cause-and-effect relationship, due to confounding factors. Important mechanisms explaining the attractiveness of larger PS leading to higher EI levels are value for money, portion distortion, labels on food packaging, and tableware. Consumers depend on external rather than internal PS cues to guide consumption, irrespective of satiety levels. Further research is recommended on food consumption patterns to inform policymakers and provide information and insights about changes in diet.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000027?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000027</dc:identifier><dc:title>Food portion sizes: trends and drivers in an obesogenic environment</dc:title><prism:startingPage>126</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>142</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000027</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000027?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-01-12</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-01-12</dc:date><dc:creator>Papagiannaki, Maria</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kerr, Maeve A.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000015?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[A narrative review on dietary components and patterns and age-related macular degeneration]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most prevalent eye diseases among the ageing population worldwide. It is a leading cause of blindness in individuals over 55, particularly in industrialised Western countries. The prevalence of AMD increases with age, and genetic factors and environmental influences are believed to contribute to its development. Among the environmental factors, diet plays a significant role in AMD. This review explores the association between dietary components, dietary patterns and AMD. Various nutrients, non-nutrient substances and dietary models that have the potential to counteract oxidative stress and inflammation, which are underlying mechanisms of AMD, are discussed. Consuming fruits, vegetables, fish and seafood, whole grains, olive oil, nuts and low-glycaemic-index foods has been highlighted as beneficial for reducing the risk of AMD. Adhering to the Mediterranean diet, which encompasses these elements, can be recommended as a dietary pattern for AMD. Furthermore, the modulation of the gut microbiota through dietary interventions and probiotics has shown promise in managing AMD.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000015?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000015</dc:identifier><dc:title>A narrative review on dietary components and patterns and age-related macular degeneration</dc:title><prism:startingPage>143</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>170</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000015</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000015?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-01-15</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-01-15</dc:date><dc:creator>Koçyiğit, Emine</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gövez, Nazlıcan Erdoğan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Arslan, Sabriye</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ağagündüz, Duygu</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000039?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Emerging evidence on selenoneine and its public health relevance in coastal populations: a review and case study of dietary Se among Inuit populations in the Canadian Arctic]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Selenium is an essential mineral yet both deficiency and excess are associated with adverse health effects. Dietary intake of Se in humans varies greatly between populations due to food availability, dietary preferences, and local geological and ecosystem processes impacting Se accumulation into agricultural products and animal populations. We argue there is a need to evaluate and reconsider the relevance of public health recommendations on Se given recent evidence, including the metabolic pathways and health implications of Se. This argument is particularly pertinent for Inuit populations in Northern Canada, who often exceed dietary tolerable upper intake levels and exhibit very high whole blood Se concentrations due to their dependence on local country foods high in the newly discovered Se compound, selenoneine. Since selenoneine appears to have lower toxicity compared to other Se species and does not contribute to the circulating pools of Se for selenoprotein synthesis, we argue that total dietary Se or total Se in plasma or whole blood are poor indicators of Se adequacy for human health in these populations. Overall, this review provides an overview of the current evidence of Se speciation, deficiency, adequacy, and excess and implications for human health and dietary recommendations, with particular reference to Inuit populations in the Canadian Arctic and other coastal populations consuming marine foods.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000039?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000039</dc:identifier><dc:title>Emerging evidence on selenoneine and its public health relevance in coastal populations: a review and case study of dietary Se among Inuit populations in the Canadian Arctic</dc:title><prism:startingPage>171</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>180</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000039</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000039?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-02-08</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-02-08</dc:date><dc:creator>Little, Matthew</dc:creator><dc:creator>Achouba, Adel</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ayotte, Pierre</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lemire, Mélanie</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000064?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Mollusc and crustacean consumption in the first 1000 days: a scoping review]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Mollusc and crustacean consumption in the first 1000 d may improve maternal and child health by providing essential nutrients. However, in some contexts, molluscs and crustaceans have been associated with allergies and environmental contamination, potentially leading to adverse health and development outcomes. It is unclear whether the health benefits of consuming molluscs and crustaceans, collectively classified as shellfish in nutrition, are outweighed by the potential risks to pregnant women and children. We conducted a scoping review (PROSPERO: CRD42022320454) in PubMed, Scopus and EBSCO Global Health of articles published between January 2000 and March 2022 that assessed shellfish consumption during pregnancy, lactation or childhood (0–2 years) in relation to maternal health, child health or child development. A total of forty-six articles were included in this review. Overall, shellfish consumption was associated with higher biomarkers of environmental contaminants, with mercury being the most studied and having the strongest evidence base. The limited research on nutritional biomarker status shows an association between shellfish consumption and iodine status. Preterm birth was not associated with shellfish consumption, but newborn anthropometry showed mixed results, with several studies reporting lower birth weight with higher shellfish consumption. The few studies that examined child development and maternal health outcomes reported no significant associations. This review revealed trade-off health risks and benefits with inclusion of molluscs and crustaceans in the dietary patterns of mothers and young children. More research is needed to understand how these aquatic animal-source foods may be safely consumed and leveraged for improving human nutrition.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000064?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000064</dc:identifier><dc:title>Mollusc and crustacean consumption in the first 1000 days: a scoping review</dc:title><prism:startingPage>181</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>191</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000064</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000064?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-02-12</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-02-12</dc:date><dc:creator>Oaks, Brietta M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gyimah, Emmanuel A.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kleban, Eliza</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ragsdale, Kathleen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Iannotti, Lora L.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000040?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Effect of vegetable consumption on risk of gastric cancer: a systematic review and multi-level meta-analysis of prospective studies]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Vegetables are known to be beneficial to human health, but the association between vegetable consumption and gastric cancer remains uncertain.

Systematic search identified thirteen prospective studies with fifty-two effect sizes that met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) showed a positive association between high vegetable consumption and low gastric cancer risk (pooled RR 0·93, 95% confidence interval 0·90–0·97, <span class='italic'>P</span> = 0·06). In moderator analyses for indicators of gender, region and quantity of vegetable intake, there was no significant difference between subgroups. However, the effect became significant in populations with lower than the minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) of vegetable consumption (<span class='italic'>P</span> &lt; 0·05). Higher vegetable intake is associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer. This effect may be limited to specific populations, such as ones with lower vegetable consumption.

Nut consumption also improves these parameters. However, less is known about the combined benefit of these two strategies. This scoping review implemented a systematic search of Medline, Embase and Scopus to identify randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of ER diets with or without nuts on body mass, body composition and glycaemic control in adults. After reviewing titles and abstracts, twenty-nine full-text articles were screened, resulting in seven studies reported in eight papers that met the inclusion criteria. Energy restriction was achieved by prescribing a set energy target or reducing intake by 1000–4200 kJ from daily energy requirements. Interventions ranged from 4 to 52 weeks in duration and contained 42–84 g/d of almonds, peanuts, pistachios or walnuts. While all studies reported that energy restriction resulted in significant weight loss, the addition of nuts to ER diets demonstrated significantly greater weight loss in only approximately half of the included studies (4/7 studies). There was limited evidence to support additional benefits from nuts for body composition measures or glycaemic control. Although improvements in weight loss and glycaemia were not consistent when nuts were included in ER diets, no study revealed an adverse effect of nut consumption on health outcomes. Future studies could explore the effect of consuming different types and amounts of nuts, combined with various levels of energy restriction on weight, body composition and glycaemic control.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000106?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000106</dc:identifier><dc:title>Effects of energy-restricted diets with or without nuts on weight, body composition and glycaemic control in adults: a scoping review</dc:title><prism:startingPage>202</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>218</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000106</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000106?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-02-23</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-02-23</dc:date><dc:creator>Mead, Lauren C.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hill, Alison M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Carter, Sharayah</dc:creator><dc:creator>Coates, Alison M.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242400012X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Challenges in identifying malnutrition in obesity; An overview of the state of the art and directions for future research]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>(Protein–energy) malnutrition in individuals living with obesity presents complex diagnostic challenges due to the distinctive physiological characteristics of obesity. This narrative review critically examines the identification of malnutrition within the population with obesity, distinguishing malnutrition in obesity from related conditions such as sarcopenic obesity. While noting some shared features, the review highlights key differences between these conditions. The review also highlights the limitations of current malnutrition screening tools, which are not designed for individuals living with obesity. These tools primarily rely on anthropometric measurements, neglecting (among others) nutrient intake assessment, which hinders accurate malnutrition detection. Additionally, this review discusses limitations in existing diagnostic criteria, including the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, when applied to individuals living with obesity. Challenges include the identification of appropriate cut-off values for phenotypic criteria (unintentional weight loss, low body mass index and muscle mass) and aetiological criteria such as reduced food intake and inflammation for the population with obesity. Overall, this review emphasises the need for modified screening tools and diagnostic criteria to recognise and assess malnutrition in obesity, leading to improved clinical outcomes and overall wellbeing.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242400012X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S095442242400012X</dc:identifier><dc:title>Challenges in identifying malnutrition in obesity; An overview of the state of the art and directions for future research</dc:title><prism:startingPage>219</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>228</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S095442242400012X</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442242400012X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-04-05</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-04-05</dc:date><dc:creator>Mwala, Natasha Nalucha</dc:creator><dc:creator>Borkent, Jos W.</dc:creator><dc:creator>van der Meij, Barbara S.</dc:creator><dc:creator>de van der Schueren, Marian A.E.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000118?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[A review of the effect of iron supplementation on the gut microbiota of children in developing countries and the impact of prebiotics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Iron is essential for many physiological functions of the body, and it is required for normal growth and development. Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common form of micronutrient malnutrition and is particularly prevalent in infants and young children in developing countries. Iron supplementation is considered the most effective strategy to combat the risk of ID and ID anaemia (IDA) in infants, although iron supplements cause a range of deleterious gut-related problems in malnourished children. The purpose of this review is to assess the available evidence on the effect of iron supplementation on the gut microbiota during childhood ID and to further assess whether prebiotics offer any benefits for iron supplementation. Prebiotics are well known to improve gut-microbial health in children, and recent reports indicate that prebiotics can mitigate the adverse gut-related effects of iron supplementation in children with ID and IDA. Thus, provision of prebiotics alongside iron supplements has the potential for an enhanced strategy for combatting ID and IDA among children in the developing world. However, further understanding is required before the benefit of such combined treatments of ID in nutritionally deprived children across populations can be fully confirmed. Such enhanced understanding is of high relevance in resource-poor countries where ID, poor sanitation and hygiene, alongside inadequate access to good drinking water and poor health systems, are serious public health concerns.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000118?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000118</dc:identifier><dc:title>A review of the effect of iron supplementation on the gut microbiota of children in developing countries and the impact of prebiotics</dc:title><prism:startingPage>229</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>237</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000118</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000118?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-04-08</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-04-08</dc:date><dc:creator>Iddrisu, Ishawu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Monteagudo-Mera, Andrea</dc:creator><dc:creator>Poveda, Carlos</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shahzad, Muhammed</dc:creator><dc:creator>Walton, Gemma E.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Andrews, Simon C.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000131?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Impact of dietary carbohydrate, fat or protein restriction on the human gut microbiome: a systematic review]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Restriction of dietary carbohydrates, fat and/or protein is often used to reduce body weight and/or treat (metabolic) diseases. Since diet is a key modulator of the human gut microbiome, which plays an important role in health and disease, this review aims to provide an overview of current knowledge of the effects of macronutrient-restricted diets on gut microbial composition and metabolites. A structured search strategy was performed in several databases. After screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria, thirty-six articles could be included. Data are included in the results only when supported by at least three independent studies to enhance the reliability of our conclusions. Low-carbohydrate (&lt;30 energy%) diets tended to induce a decrease in the relative abundance of several health-promoting bacteria, including <span class='italic'>Bifidobacterium</span>, as well as a reduction in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels in faeces. In contrast, low-fat diets (&lt;30 energy%) increased alpha diversity, faecal SCFA levels and abundance of some beneficial bacteria, including <span class='italic'>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.</span> There were insufficient data to draw conclusions concerning the effects of low-protein (&lt;10 energy%) diets on gut microbiota. Although the data of included studies unveil possible benefits of low-fat and potential drawbacks of low-carbohydrate diets for human gut microbiota, the diversity in study designs made it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Using a more uniform methodology in design, sample processing and sharing raw sequence data could foster our understanding of the effects of macronutrient restriction on gut microbiota composition and metabolic dynamics relevant to health.

From a pathogenetic prospective, T2DM is driven by insulin resistance defined as a blunted response of tissues to insulin which leads to chronic hyperglycaemia. Mechanistically, lipotoxicity and particularly the intracellular accumulation of ceramides in the skeletal muscle and the liver, is a primary metabolic aberration underpinning insulin resistance. Indeed, intracellular ceramide accumulation can hamper insulin signal transduction pathway thereby promoting insulin resistance. This review will provide an updated overview of the metabolic defects underlaying ceramide buildup and the molecular mechanism by which ceramides imping upon insulin signalling. Additionally, the role of specific ceramide subspecies as potential biomarkers for T2DM and the role of both long- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids as a modulator of ceramide metabolism will be discussed.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000179?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000179</dc:identifier><dc:title>Ceramides as the molecular link between impaired lipid metabolism, saturated fatty acid intake and insulin resistance: are all saturated fatty acids to be blamed for ceramide-mediated lipotoxicity?</dc:title><prism:startingPage>256</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>266</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000179</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000179?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-09-12</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-09-12</dc:date><dc:creator>Sergi, Domenico</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zauli, Enrico</dc:creator><dc:creator>Celeghini, Claudio</dc:creator><dc:creator>Previati, Maurizio</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zauli, Giorgio</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000143?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[What is the dietary intake and nutritional status of defence members: a systematic literature review]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Optimal diet and nutrition is vital for military readiness, performance and recovery. Previous research on military diets has primarily focused on the nutritional composition of field/combat rations and dietary intake during deployment. There is accumulating research exploring the usual free-living dietary intake and nutritional status of defence members in garrison (i.e. military bases on which personnel are stationed). However, no comprehensive review has been conducted to assess the overall dietary quality of defence members internationally. Therefore, this review assessed the diets of military populations against national nutritional guidelines and Military Dietary Reference Intakes (MDRI). A systematic literature review of original research was conducted. CINAHL, Medline (EBSCO), Scopus (Elsevier), PubMed and AMED databases were searched up to the 20/02/2023. A total of thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall quality of included studies was high, with a low risk of bias. The diet quality scores indicate poor to fair diet quality among defence members. Defence members display low intakes of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, seafood, plant protein and nuts and high intakes of added sugars, trans fat and processed meat. Results also indicated suboptimal intake of fibre, essential fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin E, folate, Mg, Zn and iodine. This may lead to reduced performance, increased risk of chronic diseases and mental health disorders. More research is needed to assess the long-term consequences of poor diet quality in defence members. These results require the attention of policymakers to ensure that military education and food environment is supportive of healthy eating.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000143?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000143</dc:identifier><dc:title>What is the dietary intake and nutritional status of defence members: a systematic literature review</dc:title><prism:startingPage>267</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>281</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000143</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000143?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-09-16</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-09-16</dc:date><dc:creator>Bayes, Jessica</dc:creator><dc:creator>Burch, Emily</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lauche, Romy</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wardle, Jon</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000234?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[The influence of zinc levels on osteoarthritis: A comprehensive review]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="graphical"><p style="float: left;"><img class='graphic' orientation='' mimeSubtype='png' mimetype='image' position='float' type='' href='S0954422424000234_figAb.png' src='http://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS0954422424000234/resource/name/S0954422424000234_figAb.png?pub-status=live'/></p></div><div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Osteoarthritis (OA), a disease with a multifactorial aetiology and an enigmatic root cause, affects the quality of life of many elderly patients. Even though there are certain medications utilised to reduce the symptomatic effects, a reliable treatment method to reverse the disease is yet to be discovered. Zinc is a cofactor of over 3000 proteins and is the only metal found in all six classes of enzymes. We explored zinc’s effect on the immune system and the bones as OA affects both. We also discussed zinc-dependent enzymes, highlighting their significant role in the disease’s pathogenesis. It is important to note that both excessive and deficient zinc levels can negatively affect bone health and immune function, thereby exacerbating OA. The purpose of this review is to offer a better understanding of zinc’s impact on OA pathogenesis and to provide clarity regarding its beneficial and detrimental outcomes. We searched thoroughly systematic reviews, meta-analysis, review articles, research articles and randomised controlled trials to ensure a comprehensive review. In brief, using zinc supplementation in the treatment of OA may act as a doubled-edged sword, offering potential benefits but also posing risks.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000234?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000234</dc:identifier><dc:title>The influence of zinc levels on osteoarthritis: A comprehensive review</dc:title><prism:startingPage>282</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>293</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000234</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000234?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-09-23</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-09-23</dc:date><dc:creator>Tekeoğlu, İbrahim</dc:creator><dc:creator>Şahin, Muhammed Zahid</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kamanlı, Ayhan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nas, Kemal</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000222?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Selenium supplementation in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing haemodialysis: a systematic review of the effects on plasma selenium, antioxidant and inflammatory markers, immunological parameters and thyroid hormones]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Selenium (Se) is a mineral with several biological functions, and studies have shown that its deficiency can be linked to many complications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aims to systematically review the effects of Se supplementation in patients with CKD undergoing haemodialysis (HD). This systematic review was carried out according to the PRISMA statement. Clinical trials were searched in PubMed, Lilacs, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases from inception to July 2021 and updated in July 2024. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021231444). Two independent reviewers performed the study screening and data extraction, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Thirteen studies were included in this review. Only nine studies showed results on Se levels; in all, reduced Se levels were observed before supplementation. A positive effect of supplementation on plasma Se level was demonstrated. Of the ten studies analysed, six demonstrated positive effects on antioxidant and inflammatory markers. Only one study analysed immunological parameters, showing a positive impact. From two studies that analysed thyroid hormones, only one showed positive results. All studies were classified as high risk of bias. The findings suggest that Se supplementation significantly increases plasma Se levels in these patients; however, there are still not enough studies to clarify the effects of Se supplementation on the antioxidant and inflammatory markers, immune system and thyroid hormones. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of Se supplementation and to provide a recommendation for patients with CKD undergoing HD.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000222?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000222</dc:identifier><dc:title>Selenium supplementation in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing haemodialysis: a systematic review of the effects on plasma selenium, antioxidant and inflammatory markers, immunological parameters and thyroid hormones</dc:title><prism:startingPage>294</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>305</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000222</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000222?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-09-25</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-09-25</dc:date><dc:creator>Trigueira, Pricilla de C.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Leal, Viviane de O.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Cardoso, Barbara R.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mafra, Denise</dc:creator><dc:creator>Araujo, Marina C.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Stockler-Pinto, Milena B.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000180?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Nutrition and health effects of pectin: A systematic scoping review of human intervention studies]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Pectin is composed of a group of complex polysaccharides that are naturally found in various plants and are associated with a range of beneficial health effects. Health outcomes from dietary pectin can vary depending on botanical origin, dietary dose and structure of pectin. The objective of this scoping review is to build a comprehensive overview of the current evidence available on intervention studies conducted in humans and to better understand the possible knowledge gaps in terms of structure–function relationships across the different health-related effects. PubMed and Embase databases were searched using PRISMA-ScR guidelines, yielding 141 references (from the initial 3704), representing 134 intervention studies performed between 1961 and 2022 that met inclusion criteria. Studies were divided into six categories, which included gut health, glycaemic response and appetite, fat metabolism, bioavailability of micronutrients, immune response and other topics. Review of these human intervention studies identified a variety of cohort characteristics and populations (life stage, health status, country), sources/types of pectin (i.e. citrus, sugarbeet, apple, other and non-defined), intervention timeframes (from one single intake to 168 d) and doses (0.1–50 g/d) that were tested for health outcomes in people. Gut health, post-prandial glucose regulation and maintenance of blood cholesterol represented the largest categories of studied outcomes. Further research to strengthen the structure–function relationships for pectin with health properties and associated outcomes is warranted and will benefit from a more precise description of physico-chemical characteristics and molecular compositions, such as degree of esterification, weight, degree of branching, viscosity, gel formation and solubility.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000180?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000180</dc:identifier><dc:title>Nutrition and health effects of pectin: A systematic scoping review of human intervention studies</dc:title><prism:startingPage>306</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>323</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000180</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000180?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-09-26</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-09-26</dc:date><dc:creator>Weber, Annika M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Pascale, Nélida</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gu, Fangjie</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ryan, Elizabeth P.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Respondek, Frederique</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000246?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Military rations: Nutritional, sensorial and technological quality and their effects on military physical exercise in extreme environments]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>In recent years, many countries have significantly increased military spending, mainly due to geopolitical instability in several regions and the potential risk of armed conflicts spreading worldwide. In this context, understanding the nutritional needs of soldiers in different climates (warm, cold and high altitude) is important and directly impacts the performance and health of soldiers, especially in extreme environments. The amount of liquids, calories, and macro- and micronutrients contained in military rations must be determined considering the type of exercise, duration and environment. Military rations, in addition to being nutritionally adequate, must be practical, sustainable and easy to consume at any temperature and situation. Given these considerations, this study aimed to review scientific knowledge regarding the convenience, sensory attributes and nutritional components of military rations. Furthermore, this review studied the factors influencing soldiers’ appetite, gut microbiota and nutritional needs during training or combat in extreme environments (warm, cold and high altitude). This exploration further advances our understanding of contemporary nutritional strategies for military personnel, contributing to future research and highlighting areas that must be developed.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000246?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000246</dc:identifier><dc:title>Military rations: Nutritional, sensorial and technological quality and their effects on military physical exercise in extreme environments</dc:title><prism:startingPage>324</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>337</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000246</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000246?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-09-26</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-09-26</dc:date><dc:creator>Vidal, Vitor Andre Silva</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jensen, Ida-Johanne</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sandbakk, Øyvind</dc:creator><dc:creator>Haugnes, Pål</dc:creator><dc:creator>Austeen, Martin Winge</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gjeldnes, Rune</dc:creator><dc:creator>Svihus, Birger</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lerfall, Jørgen</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000210?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Biological properties of vitamin B12]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Vitamin B<span class='sub'>12</span>, cobalamin, is indispensable for humans owing to its participation in two biochemical reactions: the conversion of <span class='sc'>l</span>-methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A, and the formation of methionine by methylation of homocysteine.

To realise its potential for global impact, we need to understand the factors that are associated with decisions to adopt biofortified crops and food products. We searched the literature to identify adoption determinants, i.e. barriers to (factors negatively associated) or facilitators of (factors positively associated) adoption, of biofortified crops and food products. We found 41 studies reporting facilitator(s) and/or barrier(s) of adoption. We categorised the factors using the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research 2.0, resulting in a set of factors that enable or constrain adoption of biofortified foods across twenty-four constructs and five domains of this meta-theoretical determinant framework from implementation science. Facilitators of orange sweet potato adoption included knowledge about importance, relative advantage, efficient production and management practices; barriers included lacking timely access to quality vines and market remoteness (28 studies total). Facilitators of vitamin A cassava adoption included awareness of its benefits and access to information; barriers included poor road networks and scarcity of improved technology including inadequate processing/storage facilities (8). Facilitators of high-iron bean adoption included farmers’ networking and high farming experience; barriers included low knowledge of bean biofortification (8). Barriers to vitamin A maize adoption included low awareness and concerns regarding yield, texture and aflatoxin contamination (1). These barriers and facilitators may be a starting point for researchers to move towards testing implementation strategies and/or for policymakers to consider before planning scale-up and continuous optimisation of ongoing projects promoting adoption of biofortified crops and food products.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000258?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000258</dc:identifier><dc:title>Review of the facilitators and barriers to adoption of biofortified foods and food products</dc:title><prism:startingPage>371</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>392</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000258</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000258?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-10-08</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-10-08</dc:date><dc:creator>Huey, Samantha L.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Islam, Saiful</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mehta, Neel H.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Konieczynski, Elsa M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Friesen, Valerie M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Krisher, Jesse T.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mbuya, Mduduzi N.

Whilst reviews of the association between coffee and cognition exist, evidence exploring effects of coffee-specific CGA on cognition has yet to be systematically synthesised. The purpose was to systematically review the current literature investigating the relationship between CGA from coffee and cognitive performance. A further objective was to undertake a meta-analysis of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT). Observational and intervention studies were included if they considered coffee-based CGA consumption in human participants and applied a standardised measure of cognition. Furthermore, intervention studies were required to define the CGA content and include a control group/placebo. Studies were excluded if they examined CGA alone as an extract or supplement. A search of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and PsycINFO resulted in including twenty-three papers, six of which were interventions. The evidence from the broader systematic review suggests that CGA from coffee may need to be consumed chronically over a sustained period to produce cognitive benefits. However, the meta-analysis of RCT showed no benefits of coffee CGA intake on cognitive function (<span class='italic'>d</span> = 0.00, 95% CI −0.05, 0.05). Overall, this review included a limited number of studies, the sample sizes were small, and a wide range of cognitive measures have been utilised. This indicates that further, good-quality interventions and RCT are required to systematically explore the conditions under which coffee CGA may provide benefits for cognitive outcomes.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000209?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0954422424000209</dc:identifier><dc:title>Impact of coffee-derived chlorogenic acid on cognition: a systematic review and meta-analysis</dc:title><prism:startingPage>393</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>406</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0954422424000209</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954422424000209?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2024-10-15</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>Nutrition Research Reviews</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2024-10-15</dc:date><dc:creator>Johal, Karen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jones, Dan J.
