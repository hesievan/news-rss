<p><em>The nutrition community is made up of individuals with diverse experiences, perspectives, and ideas. This diversity is the fundamental strength of our professional society. Through this&nbsp;</em><a href="https://nutrition.org/category/asn-member-spotlight/"><em>member spotlight series</em></a><em>, we celebrate our diversity and the vast achievements made by our members in the field.</em></p>



<p>Meet ASN’s 2025–2026 President, Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa, PhD, DFASN, FTOS, FAHA. A dedicated ASN member since 1994, Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa has served the Society in numerous leadership roles, including Director At-Large for the Nutrition Science Mechanisms Research Interest Section, as well as on various committees and in other GEM leadership positions. Earlier this year, she was inducted into the 2025 Class of Distinguished Fellows of ASN (DFASN), the highest honor awarded by the Society.</p>



<p>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa <a href="https://nutrition.org/the-american-society-for-nutrition-welcomes-new-president-dr-naima-moustaid-moussa-and-new-leadership-on-the-board-of-directors/">officially began her term</a> on June 18, 2025, succeeding Sarah L. Booth, PhD, who now serves as Past President. We <a href="https://nutrition.org/asn-member-spotlight-dr-naima-moustaid-moussa/">first spotlighted</a> Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa’s work in 2023, and in the following interview, ASN’s Member Engagement Coordinator, Sara Genell, reconnects with her to discuss her presidential priorities and vision for ASN.</p>

<p><strong>Sara Genell</strong>: <em>Thank you, Dr. Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa, for participating in this member spotlight interview. Your interview from December 2023 introduced you, your background, and involvement with ASN, so for this interview, I’d like to focus on your presidential priorities, if that’s alright with you.</em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa</strong>: Hi Sara, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the Society. Let’s dive right in.</p>



<p><strong>Genell</strong>: <em>Great! To begin, can you highlight a couple of your presidential priorities and how you plan to achieve them during your term?</em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa</strong>: Two of my <a href="https://nutrition.org/businessmeeting/">presidential priorities</a> relate to expanding and strengthening global partnerships. While ASN is US-based, it is a global society as its members come from 115 countries from around the world.  We already have several ongoing partnerships with international nutrition societies or associations that I have been working on with ASN staff, especially with Senior Vice President, Business Development and Sales, Dante Preciado, and our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. John Courtney. One of my priorities will focus specifically on partnerships with Africa and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries, and South America, as well as engaging with specific international organizations interested in nutrition science and/or food systems such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).  To do so, I am actively communicating and engaging with leaders from these organizations to identify effective collaborations of mutual interest that advance nutrition science and benefit our members.  My other relevant priority with a global reach is to expand ASN’s role in advocacy, policy and education in the US and abroad to support its members. An important goal here is to advocate for nutrition research and education nationally and globally, with emphasis on developing the nutrition workforce and our future leaders, and to advocate for the importance of appropriate funding and training to support this nutrition workforce.  ASN’s Chief Science Policy Officer, Sarah Ohlhorst, has already been doing exceptional work in nutrition policy and advocacy, and I look forward to working with her to further advance this area. These partnerships add value to our members, support the <a href="https://nutrition.org/about-asn/">ASN 2028 Vision</a>, and increase ASN’s role as a premier nutrition society, as we provide opportunities for ASN members locally, regionally and internationally, to collaborate, share mentoring opportunities, and increase nutrition knowledge across the globe. These priorities will engage our ASN members from private, government and academic institutions in the US and worldwide, across the different areas of nutrition research, education, and practice.</p>



<p><strong>Genell</strong><em>: Are there any specific initiatives or programs you’d like to implement or expand upon during your term?</em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa</strong>: I have continued to attend ASN meetings since 1994, from the EB meetings to NUTRITION meetings and I enjoy learning from the breadth of nutrition research and practice being presented during our flagship annual meeting.  However, there is also great value in interacting in smaller groups around specific topics of interest to various members, especially for our early career members.  Such opportunities will reengage more basic science researchers in ASN. For this reason, I will be working with ASN members, staff and the Board of Directors to develop regional conferences and workshops on specific topics related to nutrition. Professional development activities for early- and mid-career members will also be included. This will be achieved by working with ASN members, GEMs and ASN staff, namely Gwen Twillman, ASN’s Chief Programs and Advancement Officer and Felicia Price, ASN’s Chief Administration Officer and ASN Foundation (ASNF) Executive Director. Besides GEMs, other important partners in this initiative include the <a href="https://nutrition.org/andp/">Academic Nutrition Departments and Programs (ANDP) Community</a>, our <a href="https://nutrition.org/our-members/sustaining-partners/">Sustaining Partners (SP)</a>, and various relevant nutrition-related professional societies and organizations. Given the cost involved, this will also require exploring revenue opportunities for sustainability of new and existing conferences through grants, sponsorship and other financial support. Specialized conferences such as these could also be organized as pre- or post- NUTRITION events, as well as incorporated into the annual meeting schedule for maximal involvement.  I envision that this will increase overall member participation in areas of interest to them, reengage and increase involvement of basic scientists but also other areas of nutrition science and practice. I look forward to hearing from ASN members who are interested in helping organize or participate in these scientific conferences and programs.</p>



<p><strong>Genell: </strong><em>Speaking of our annual NUTRITION meeting, you have transitioned into your Presidential term just after our flagship annual meeting, NUTRITION 2025. What were your biggest takeaways from the meeting this year, in terms of trends and/or the state of the field?</em><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa: </strong>NUTRITION 2025 was a great conference highlighting state-of-the-art science, from basic, translation, and clinical research to community/population research, policy and practice. There was a wealth of information and new knowledge presented. A few important topics remain present and relevant year after year ranging from maternal-child health, and prenatal nutrition to various bioactive compounds that improve health. This year at NUTRITION 2025, we had <a href="https://nutrition.org/american-society-for-nutrition-foundation-and-novo-nordisk-foundation-announce-inaugural-awardees-advancing-nutrition-and-obesity-science/">two new award lectures</a> through partnership of the ASNF and the Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF) that sponsored these awards, which funded two exceptional scientists: the 2025 ASNF-NNF Flemming Quaade Award for Innovative Approaches in Childhood Obesity by Dr. Andrew Agbaje, University of Eastern Finland, and the 2025 ASNF-NNF Henrik Dam Award for foundational and translational nutrition research by Dr. Julia L. Finkelstein from Cornell University. The Opening Session highlighted another timely topic on food security and food access during periods of emergencies, natural disaster and war situations and the importance of attending to nutritional needs during such challenging situations across the lifespan. The importance and role of the gut microbiome and gut health in health and disease remained a key topic this year as well, with several presentations on rigorous approaches in this field, from methodologies, data collection and analyses to interpretation to impact. Other timely lectures highlighted where ASN members and the nutrition field can make a difference. This specifically pertained to anti-obesity drugs (GLP1-RA), that often come with potential malnutrition, thus the importance of raising awareness of the nutritional needs and requirements of patients on these effective medications. Last but not least, I am very proud to see ASN continuing to support and engage early career scientists, especially during these challenging times for the workforce in academia or government. There were many presentations and award competitions across the nutrition areas by early career members and many professional and career development activities, some of which were supported by our SPs.</p>

<p><strong>Genell: </strong><em>ASN’s membership covers all career stages and many disciplines within nutrition science. How do you recommend members get involved with the Society to grow their networks and careers?</em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa</strong>: Nutrition is a very broad multi- and trans-disciplinary field. I highly encourage ASN members to maximize their participation in ASN and ASN conferences which provide an opportunity to learn about many relevant topics that may help them further elevate the work they do. Some members may only attend sessions related to their specific research at NUTRITION conferences, but by doing so they are missing opportunities to potentially expand their work into new and novel directions.&nbsp; Poster sessions and networking events are great opportunities to meet potential new mentors and collaborators from across the globe and increase our knowledge. There are many <a href="https://nutrition.org/our-members/research-interest-sections/call-for-nominations-applications/">opportunities to volunteer in GEMs</a>. This is how I started my involvement in ASN back in the 1990s. I joined the Nutrient-Gene Interactions Research Interest Section (NGI RIS) back when I was a new assistant professor. Through the NGI RIS, I met many colleagues and collaborators that enriched my career and shaped my research trajectory; I also went on to serve as Chair of the NGI RIS and continued to be involved in ASN in various scientific and leadership capacities. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Genell: </strong><em>Thinking back to your interview with us from December 2023, how has your perspective evolved, if at all, now that you are stepping into this new role as ASN President?</em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa</strong>: Increasingly, we all realize that our world is very interconnected, as highlighted most recently by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; I firmly believe that exchange and sharing of knowledge is very important. Scientists do this, but this exchange becomes even more valuable when shared across the globe, not just within one country or one region. At the current time, nutrition is an even more critical area to advance, not only within human nutrition or food science but also through integrating the One Health approach to understand how our interactions with animals affect our health and nutritional status, and how environmental contaminants or pollutants such as PFAS and microplastics, or extreme weather conditions such as drought and floodings or natural disasters affect human health (and animal health) and how nutritional status may contribute to the spread of or aggravate infectious diseases. Situations may be different from one region or country to another, but we can learn from each other through exchange of information and knowledge. That is why you see One Health as one of my priorities.</p>



<p><strong>Genell: </strong><em>You are the executive director of the Institute for One Health Innovation. In what ways will you bring a One Health perspective to leading ASN? Why do you feel it is important to take a One Health lens when conducting nutrition research?</em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa</strong>: One of my priorities is to raise awareness about the importance of the One Health approach in nutrition research, education and practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; One Health is the most sustainable approach to achieve optimal health for all, by recognizing that the health of animals, humans, plants and ecosystems are closely connected and intertwined, and we must view health and healthcare more holistically. &nbsp;One Health integrates disciplines from basic nutrition and food sciences, or plant and animal sciences, to environmental health to solve challenges in our food systems that impact human nutrition and health. Towards this goal, we recently published an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.05.001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editorial on Advancing One Health in <em>The Journal of Nutrition</em></a> where we also announced a special issue on One Health inviting ASN members to showcase their research in this area.&nbsp; The editorial provides some additional examples of the intricate role of One Health in human nutrition and health. An example that many can relate to are food systems and agricultural production and practices, focused on the role of soil health in human health; specifically, how soil quality and microbial composition impacts crops’ (food) nutritional value and content, which in turn affects animal or human health. We also know that conditions such as extreme temperatures, drought, flooding, and other environmental factors can change these interactions. These are all current and continuing challenges that require multidisciplinary experts to work together and contribute the expertise needed to solve these challenges. In addition to this special issue, I look forward to more programming by ASN on the topic of One Health including at NUTRITION 2026 and throughout the year. These activities further support ASN’s 2028 vision, ASN journals’ reach and visibility, and provide opportunities for more collaboration with industry, animal, food and environmental sciences and agricultural disciplines and organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Genell: </strong><em>How do you think (or hope) the field of nutrition science and practice will evolve in the next 10 years? What is ASN’s role in this evolution?</em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa</strong>: We have seen the increased prevalence of emerging infectious diseases but also the sustained increase in non-communicable diseases such as obesity and diabetes; and these will continue to pose economic and health burdens. Nutrition research may be at the center of solving these challenges. We have made significant progress in the past decade towards precision and individualized nutrition through the development of sophisticated omics tools and nutritional assessment tools. However, much work remains to be done to achieve true precision nutrition. We still rely on self-reported data, and many advanced methods used in the clinic are not always easily transposable to the community. Methodologies have been improved to more accurately measure food intake and assess biomarkers of health including research on gut microbiota or their metabolites that affect health. However, implementation of these advances at the community level are not there yet and much remains to be done on translating findings from microbiome research into therapies.&nbsp; I anticipate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play an increasingly greater role in implementing precision nutrition and in translating and accelerating research applications into clinical practice.&nbsp; As mentioned above, emerging infectious diseases are major threats, and we do not fully understand the role of nutrition deficiencies or malnutrition on the spread of these diseases in animals or humans.</p>



<p><strong>Genell: </strong><em>Thank you again, Dr. </em>Moustaïd<em>-Moussa, for addressing our Society through this spotlight interview. Are there any closing remarks or call to action you would like to leave with the ASN members reading this interview?</em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa</strong>: ASN has had a great impact on my career and professional development, and I highly encourage our members, especially early- and mid-career members, to actively engage in ASN and help guide and shape the future vision of ASN and nutrition research, education and practice.  This is such an important time for nutrition science, as our field plays an increasingly critical role in shaping national and global health. ASN members have a big responsibility to ensure that we are guided by evidence-based nutrition. We must also communicate what we do to our stakeholders and policymakers. Related to my <a href="https://nutrition.org/businessmeeting/">priorities</a>, I look forward to hearing feedback from our members and partners, and to see them engaged not only in these priorities, as relevant, but overall to advance nutrition science and the ASN 2028 vision to achieve a healthier world through nutrition.</p>



<p>In closing, thanks so much Sara for this comprehensive interview, and I would like to take this opportunity to also thank all ASN staff for their dedication and the great work they do to support ASN and its members.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>&nbsp;Evidence-based nutrition and lifestyle interventions enhance GLP-1 treatment outcomes for obesity, improving adherence, health gains, and long-term weight maintenance</em></strong></h3>



<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> This press release has been altered from its original version to correct the citations that appear in the fifth paragraph.</em></p>



<p><strong>Washington, D.C. (May 30, 2025) </strong>– Four leading organizations in lifestyle medicine, obesity medicine, and nutrition—the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), the American Society for Nutrition (ASN), the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA), and The Obesity Society (TOS)—have jointly released a clinical advisory titled <strong>“Nutritional Priorities to Support GLP-1 Therapy for Obesity.”</strong> Published across four peer-reviewed journals, this consensus-based guidance reflects an interdisciplinary collaboration to help clinicians support patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity care with evidence-based nutritional and behavioral strategies.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00240-0/fulltext">Read the article in AJCN</a></div>
</div>



<p>GLP-1 therapies, including both single and combination agents, have emerged as powerful tools in the management of obesity, demonstrating <strong>average placebo-adjusted weight reductions of 5–18% in clinical trials</strong>, along with improvements in metabolic, functional and cardiovascular outcomes. However, <strong>sustaining these benefits over time and maximizing patient outcomes require comprehensive care that integrates lifestyle intervention—particularly nutrition therapy—into the treatment plan.</strong></p>



<p>“GLP-1s represent an important advancement in obesity care,” said lead author and advisory chair Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, of Tufts University. “But these medications can present challenges, including gastrointestinal side effects, risk of micronutrient deficiencies, muscle and bone loss, poor long-term adherence with subsequent weight regain, and high costs; and, on their own, are not enough. Nutrition therapy and lifestyle support are essential components to address these challenges, help patients maximize and maintain health gains over time, and ensure we are using these drugs wisely, effectively, and without bankrupting the healthcare system.”</p>



<p>The advisory outlines <strong>eight key nutritional priorities</strong> to support patients on GLP-1 medications, emphasizing the importance of (1) patient-centered initiation of therapy, (2) careful baseline nutritional assessment, (3) management of gastrointestinal side effects, (4) personalized, nutrient-dense, minimally processed diets, (5) prevention of micronutrient deficiencies (6) adequate protein intake and strength training to preserve lean mass, (7) leveraging a good diet to maximize weight reduction, and (8) promoting other lifestyle changes around activity, sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections to maximize long-term success.</p>



<p>Recent evidence supports this integrative model. In studies evaluating combined pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions, <strong>patients receiving both GLP-1 therapy and structured nutrition guidance achieved greater weight loss, better adherence, and were more likely to sustain weight loss after discontinuing medication compared to those receiving pharmacotherapy alone </strong>(Jastreboff et al., 2022; Wadden et al.,&nbsp;2023; White et al., 2023; Wilding et al.,&nbsp;2021; Wilding et al.,&nbsp;2022; Wilding et al.,&nbsp;2023).</p>



<p>Despite the known benefits, most individuals prescribed GLP-1s do not currently receive adequate nutritional counseling or behavioral support. This advisory seeks to fill that gap with practical, interdisciplinary guidance for implementation in clinical practice.</p>



<p>While certain considerations—such as GI tolerance and micronutrient balance—are important for clinicians to address, the advisory emphasizes that a <strong>proactive lifestyle-based approach can mitigate risks and optimize outcomes.</strong> With obesity prevalence continuing to rise worldwide, the integration of nutrition therapy into GLP-1-based care offers a scalable strategy to extend the clinical and economic value of these therapies.</p>



<p>The joint advisory is simultaneously published in the following scholarly journals:<br>● <em>American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine </em>(ACLM)<br>● <em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> (ASN)<br>● <em>Obesity Pillars®</em> (OMA)<br>● <em>Obesity</em> (TOS)</p>



<p>Clinicians are encouraged to use the advisory’s tools and frameworks to help patients translate nutrition guidance into sustainable behaviors, making lifestyle medicine an active ingredient in every “prescription” for obesity care.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting quotes:<br></strong>“GLP-1s are transforming the treatment of obesity, with immense potential for weight loss and improving health outcomes,” said Jasdeep Saluja, MD, FRCPC, DipABLM, DipABOM, chair of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine’s GLP-1 Task Force. “This joint advisory offers practical priorities for incorporating nutritional and other lifestyle treatments into GLP-1 therapy to maximize effectiveness, obtain more equitable outcomes, and optimize cost-effectiveness in the real world. As clinicians navigate the shifting care landscape for obesity, we hope this information empowers them to manage potential pitfalls, such as gastrointestinal side effects, nutritional needs, and preserving skeletal and muscular body mass.&#8221;</p>



<p>“GLP-1s are reshaping the landscape of obesity treatment, but it’s clear that medication alone is not a complete solution,&#8221; stated John E. Courtney, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of the American Society for Nutrition. &#8220;This consensus-based guidance highlights the critical role of nutrition in supporting patients on GLP-1 therapy, with clear recommendations for health care providers to optimize outcomes, reduce risks, and fill urgent gaps in care through practical, evidence-informed nutrition strategies.”</p>



<p>“As an obesity specialist grounded in both lifestyle and culinary medicine, I see food not just as fuel, but as a foundational tool in clinical care,&#8221; stated Lydia Alexander, MD, DABOM, DABLM, MFOMA, Immediate Past President of the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA). “GLP-1 therapies are powerful, but they’re most effective when paired with intentional, nutrient-dense eating patterns that support metabolic health and long-term success. Nutrition is not an afterthought—it’s a therapeutic partner that helps patients sustain weight loss, preserve lean mass, and translate medication-driven progress into lasting well-being.”</p>



<p>“Medical therapy for obesity and lifestyle changes go and-in-hand,&#8221; stated Marc-Andre Cornier, MD, FTOS, president of The Obesity Society. &#8220;This guidance lays a nutrition roadmap to help providers support their patients on sustainable and lasting weight reduction journeys. It underscores the importance of nutrition on quality of life, and is an important contribution to the literature about incorporating lifestyle interventions into obesity care.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Adolescent health</strong>&nbsp;– Adolescence is a key period for physical, mental and reproductive development, but it&#8217;s also a time when young people are especially influenced by societal, cultural and environmental factors. Factors related to nutrition in adolescence can affect a person’s long-term health and even the health of their future children. This session will examine ways to ensure optimal adolescent nutrition.

<p><strong>Gut health</strong>&nbsp;– The term “gut health” has become a catchall marketing phrase for numerous health-promoting outcomes. Although we know that gut function is integral to health, many questions remain: Is gut health different from digestive or gastrointestinal health? What is the overall importance of gut health? How should it be measured? In this session, experts will present the latest research into what constitutes a healthy gut and how that is measured. (What is ‘Gut Health’?

<p>Dr. Finkelstein’s groundbreaking research has demonstrated a high global burden of vitamin B<sub>12 </sub>deficiency in women of reproductive age and identified a critical role of periconceptional vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in maternal and child health. Through population-based biomarker surveillance, longitudinal cohort studies, and randomized clinical trials, this work has informed evidence-based interventions and policy to improve the health of women and children. With methodological rigor, Dr. Finkelstein’s work has influenced clinical guidelines and nutrition policy globally, including through collaborations with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>Dr. Sander Kersten, the Director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences said, “We are thrilled that Dr. Finkelstein is the inaugural recipient of this new award. It is incredibly well-deserved and recognition of her research and its global impact.”</p>



<p>In addition to her scientific achievements, Dr. Finkelstein has demonstrated a deep commitment to mentorship and capacity strengthening globally, including NIH training programs in nutrition and maternal and child health, and the development of Cochrane and nutrition research methods courses that have equipped hundreds of health professionals in low- and middle-income settings with critical research skills.</p>



<p>The award includes a research grant of 1.7 million Danish kroner (DKK) (~$240,000 USD); a personal award of 300,000 DKK (~$42,000 USD); a grant to host a symposium at her home institution; and an invited plenary lecture at <strong><a href="http://nutrition.org/meeting">NUTRITION 2025</a></strong>, the flagship meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, taking place May 31–June 3, 2025, in Orlando, Florida.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dr. Andrew Agbaje Receives the ASNF-NNF Flemming Quaade Award for Innovative Approaches to Childhood Obesity</h3>



<p>Andrew Agbaje, MD, MPH, PhD, FACC, FESC, FHAA, FNYAM has been named the first recipient of the <strong>Flemming Quaade Award for Innovative Approaches to Childhood Obesity</strong>, honoring early-career physicians who have made exceptional contributions to obesity prevention or management. He currently serves as Associate Professor of Clinical Epidemiology and Child Health at the University of Eastern Finland.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1030" height="431" src="https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-1030x431.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-40803" srcset="https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-1030x431.jpg 1030w, https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-600x251.jpg 600w, https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-300x126.jpg 300w, https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-768x322.jpg 768w, https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-1536x643.jpg 1536w, https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-2048x858.jpg 2048w, https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-480x201.jpg 480w, https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-640x268.jpg 640w, https://nutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Andrew-Agbaje-Headshot-1920x804.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /></figure>



<p>Dr. Agbaje’s groundbreaking research has shown that waist circumference-to-height ratio is a more accurate predictor of obesity and metabolic diseases than the traditional Body Mass Index (BMI). He recently launched a clinical calculator based on this metric, offering a potentially transformative tool for the early detection and management of childhood obesity. Dr. Agbaje discovered arterial stiffness as a novel risk factor for pediatric obesity and insulin resistance and was recently named the world’s third-best highly ranked scholar in the arterial stiffness specialty. His work has further revealed adolescence as the critical window for interrupting the fat mass-insulin resistance pathologic cycle. Notably, he has demonstrated that light-intensity physical activity is a highly effective strategy for reversing excessive fat accumulation caused by sedentary behavior in childhood. Dr. Agbaje has served as an expert advisor to the World Health Organization’s committee on childhood obesity prevention.</p>



<p>Award benefits include a research grant of 500,000 DKK (~$70,000 USD) and a travel stipend to present a lecture at <strong><a href="https://nutrition.org/meeting/">NUTRITION 2025</a></strong>.</p>



<p>“It is with great pleasure that we congratulate the first two winners of the ASNF-NNF awards. These awards aim to acknowledge early and mid-career professionals for their innovative research within the growing field of nutritional science and health,” expressed Arne Astrup, Professor, MD, DMSc, and Senior Vice President of Obesity and Nutrition Science at the Novo Nordisk Foundation. “Eighty-two years after Henrik Dam received the Nobel prize for his work on Vitamin K, Dr. Finkelstein receives the inaugural ASNF-NNF Henrik Dam Award for her pioneering work on B<sub>12</sub>, hence demonstrating the continued importance of micronutrient research. Nutrition is fundamental to our overall health, and prioritizing research in this field will impact health globally. We look forward to celebrating the winners&#8217; remarkable contributions to the nutrition field at NUTRITION 2025.”</p>



<p>Both award lectures will be streamed live through the <a href="https://nutrition.org/meeting/digital-pass/">NUTRITION 2025 Digital Pass</a>. For more information on how to view the lectures, visit <a href="http://nutrition.org/meeting/digital-pass">nutrition.org/meeting/digital-pass</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Investing in the Future of Nutrition Science</h3>



<p>These awards are part of a multi-year partnership between the ASNF and NNF to recognize rising stars in nutrition research and accelerate breakthroughs in global health. The Novo Nordisk Foundation has committed funding for the awards through 2027 and plays no role in the selection of recipients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The work of Drs. Finkelstein and Agbaje exemplifies the scientific impact we aim to recognize with these awards. Expanding the evidence base to bridge knowledge gaps and support nutrition interventions is critical,” stated Paul M. Coates, PhD, Chair, Board of Trustees of the American Society for Nutrition Foundation. “We commend the Novo Nordisk Foundation for their extraordinary commitment to support these talented investigators.”&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The American Society for Nutrition (ASN) remains dedicated to the advancement of the science, education and practice of nutrition and fulfilling our vision of “A Healthier World Through Evidence-Based Nutrition” as we approach our 100-year anniversary. Critical to our success have been our nearly 8,000 members around the world, working throughout government, clinical practice, academia, and industry, to create, translate, and disseminate nutrition science. Our efforts involve the entire nutrition community, and include members with diverse experiences, perspectives, and ideas, to make the ASN mission and vision a reality.</p>



<p>Many ASN members now find their research and work threatened, given uncertainties and challenges to the research enterprise. Some federally sponsored nutrition research has been paused or stopped and impacted employment and professional development for many within the U.S. federal government, at institutions of higher education, and elsewhere. The next generation of nutrition scientists and researchers may now be unsure of their path. Additional challenges are anticipated, with implications to budgets, personnel, and programs, and domestic and global societal impacts. It’s a time of confusion, but also opportunity. ASN remains resolute in our dedication to support our members. We are, as always, in this together. There has never been a more important time to support one another!</p>



<p>In response to these ongoing challenges to nutrition research, the ASN Board of Directors, supported by ASN staff, are taking thoughtful steps to support the membership, particularly those impacted. As always, ASN continues our outreach to Congress and the Administration, our important work through the ASN Committee on Advocacy and Science Policy, and collaborations with coalitions and other organizations.</p>



<p>New opportunities for members are also listed below. More information will follow for many of these events.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Advances in Nutrition<em> review finds soy consumption does not interfere with estrogenicity, but rather it can support women’s health and a healthier planet</em></h3>



<p>The results of human studies indicate that soy lowers your risk for heart disease, resulting in health benefits claims for soy in Canada and the US.&nbsp; These potential heart health benefits are particularly important for women as cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women.&nbsp; In particular, cardiovascular disease risk increases significantly during menopause.&nbsp; Moreover, studies have shown that cardiovascular disease among women is under-recognized and under-treated.</p>



<p>There is also substantial evidence that soy isoflavones, a compound found in soy, reduces the risk of estrogen-sensitive cancers such as breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer.&nbsp; Moreover, soy isoflavones can improve bone health and memory.</p>



<p>Finally, soy isoflavones can help alleviate menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. &nbsp;While many women use hormone replacement therapy to manage the symptoms of menopause, not all women are good candidates for this therapy due to contraindications, including cardiovascular disease and estrogen-sensitive cancers.&nbsp; In these cases, soy isoflavones may be an appropriate treatment option, according to a 2023 position statement of The North American Menopause Society.</p>



<p>Despite the health benefits that soy foods can offer women, controversies around the effects of soy foods and their components, especially soy isoflavones, are a barrier to their acceptance.&nbsp; Soy isoflavones are a type of plant estrogen, also known as a phytoestrogen, that are similar in chemical structure to human estrogen. &nbsp;These isoflavones can bind to human estrogen receptors in the body and therefore potentially interfere with estrogenicity, a term which refers to the way the human body produces and deploys estrogen to regulate various bodily functions.</p>



<p>The negative beliefs surrounding soy isoflavones, including the belief that they may worsen outcomes for estrogen-sensitive breast cancer, have been predominantly driven by the results of animal studies. &nbsp;These studies, however, have limited implications for human health, in part due to differences in how rodents and humans metabolize soy isoflavones. &nbsp;Moreover, human studies on the effects of soy isoflavones have not replicated the negative health risks reported in comparable animal studies.&nbsp; Nonetheless, consumption of soy foods is low among North Americans, with only 3-4% reporting consumption of a soy-containing product on any given day.</p>



<p>There has been a recent shift in both national dietary guidelines and cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines that emphasizes the consumption of plant protein foods to support public and planetary health. &nbsp;Soy is a high-quality plant protein food with a low environmental impact and cost that can play an important role in supporting these guidelines. &nbsp;As a result, there is a public health need to better understand and characterize soy isoflavones to support their consumption. In response, the authors of <a href="https://advances.nutrition.org/article/S2161-8313(24)00161-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Effect of Soy Isoflavones on Measures of Estrogenicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials</a>&nbsp; evaluated the effect of soy isoflavones on postmenopausal women, using four measures of estrogenicity: endometrial thickness, vaginal maturation, levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (a hormone that regulates sexual development and reproduction), and circulating estradiol, the most common form of estrogen. &nbsp;These measures were chosen because they are known to be affected by the hormone estrogen and have been evaluated in several clinical trials involving soy isoflavones.&nbsp; The review was published in <em><a href="https://advances.nutrition.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advances in Nutrition—An International Review Journal</a></em>, a publication of the American Society for Nutrition.</p>



<p>In order to conduct their research, the authors searched the scientific literature for relevant studies published up to August 2024, leading them to 40 randomized controlled trials, involving 3,285 women. &nbsp;Following their analysis of these trials, the authors concluded that “soy isoflavones do not exhibit estrogenic effects compared to non-isoflavone controls on four measures of estrogenicity in postmenopausal women.” &nbsp;Moreover, the results of this scientific review “provide a strong rationale for not assuming that soy isoflavones will exert health effects similar to the hormone estrogen.”</p>



<p>Although most of the controlled randomized trials in the authors’ analysis provided soy isoflavones as capsules, the results did not differ from trials in which soy isoflavones were provided in the form of soy protein-based beverages or foods. &nbsp;“However,” the authors noted, “because soy foods contain numerous biologically active components, whole soy foods may exert benefits beyond isoflavones alone on health outcomes, such as cholesterol for which soy protein has a health claim.”</p>



<p>In summary, this study demonstrates that soy and soy isoflavones are safe to consume: most notably, they are heart healthy and may alleviate menopausal symptoms.&nbsp; This conclusion may help alleviate some of the hesitancy women feel towards incorporating soy into their diets.&nbsp; Moreover, it supports dietary recommendations to consume more plant proteins to promote heart health, offering an environmentally sustainable alternative to animal-based proteins. </p>



<p>To help spread the word that soy and soy isoflavones are safe for postmenopausal women to consume, lead author Gabrielle Viscardi has developed an infographic under the aegis of the Nutritional Sciences Department of the University of Toronto.
