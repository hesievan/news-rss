Hypervitaminosis A can disrupt metabolic processes; however, the extent and mechanisms of these impacts are not well understood. This study aims to assess metabolic differences related to hypervitaminosis A and VA supplementation by performing metabolomics analysis. A subsample of South African preschoolers participating in the country’s VA supplementation programme was selected. Participants were divided into two groups: adequate VA (<span class='italic'>n</span> 15; 0·59–0·99 µmol/g total liver reserve and high VA (<span class='italic'>n</span> 15; ≥ 1·0 µmol/g total liver reserve). Serum samples were collected at baseline and 28 d after consuming a 200 000 IU VA supplement. Lipidomics and oxylipins assays were conducted using ultraperformance LC-MS. At baseline, unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines and unsaturated phosphatidylcholines were significantly lower in the high VA group (<span class='italic'>P</span> &lt; 0·05). A group-by-time interaction with VA supplementation was observed for polyunsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines and polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines (<span class='italic'>P</span> &lt; 0·05). Additionally, a group effect was noted for oxylipins, and a time effect in response to VA supplementation was seen with decreased arachidonic acid and lipoxygenase- and non-enzymatically derived oxylipins (<span class='italic'>P</span> &lt; 0·05). Hypervitaminosis A is associated with modifications in lipids involved in cell structure and signalling, particularly unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylcholines. Further research is needed to identify the mechanisms behind these modifications, their physiological effects and their potential as biomarkers of elevated vitamin A status.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103656?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525103656</dc:identifier><dc:title>Metabolomics profiling of hypervitaminosis A in South African preschoolers is characterised by modified serum lysophospholipids and oxylipins</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1385</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1394</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525103656</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103656?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-06-17</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-06-17</dc:date><dc:creator>Cohen, Rairaja</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sheftel, Jesse</dc:creator><dc:creator>Luevano, Jennifer</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kelly, Meredith O.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fanter, Rob K.</dc:creator><dc:creator>van Stuijvenberg, Martha E.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dhansay, Muhammad A.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Brito, Alex</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tanumihardjo, Sherry A.</dc:creator><dc:creator>La Frano, Michael R.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103553?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Association between consumption of ultra-processed foods and C-reactive protein: findings from study of cardiovascular risks in adolescents (ERICA)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Modern Western diets, characterised by a substantial proportion of kilocalories derived from ultra-processed foods (UPF), have been associated with systemic inflammation. This study examines the association between UPF consumption and inflammation, assessed through alterations in C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, among Brazilian adolescents. This is a cross-sectional study involving a sub-sample of 6316 adolescents aged 12–17 years, participants in the Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents (ERICA), from seven capitals in Brazil. Dietary intake was assessed using a 24-hour recall, and foods were categorised based on their degree of processing according to the NOVA classification. UPF consumption was then divided into quartiles. For CRP evaluation, blood samples were collected after a 12-hour fasting period and categorised as &gt; 3 mg/l, indicating low-grade inflammation. Poisson regression models with robust variance were employed to assess the association between UPF consumption and high CRP concentrations. High UPF consumption (highest quartile, ≥ 44·9 % kcal/d) was slightly associated with a higher prevalence of CRP after adjusting for potential confounders (prevalence ratio = 1·039; 95 % CI: 1·006, 1·073), compared with those in the lowest quartile of UPF consumption. However, when evaluating different groups of UPF separately (such as sugary beverages, processed meats and sweets), the previous association was no longer observed. These findings suggest a modest association between overall UPF consumption and early indicators of unhealthy low-grade inflammation in adolescents. Further experimental and cohort studies are necessary to clarify the role of UPF in inflammatory processes.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103553?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525103553</dc:identifier><dc:title>Association between consumption of ultra-processed foods and C-reactive protein: findings from study of cardiovascular risks in adolescents (ERICA)</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1395</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1403</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525103553</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103553?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-06-03</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-06-03</dc:date><dc:creator>dos Santos, Gabriela Rocha</dc:creator><dc:creator>Rosa, Priscila Bárbara Zanini</dc:creator><dc:creator>Martins, Nina Nayara Ferreira</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mendes, Larissa Loures</dc:creator><dc:creator>do Carmo, Ariene Silva</dc:creator><dc:creator>Schaan, Beatriz D.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Cureau, Felipe Vogt</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525000443?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Diet’s total antioxidant capacity and women’s health: systematic review and meta-analysis]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="graphical"><p style="float: left;"><img class='graphic' orientation='' mimeSubtype='png' mimetype='image' position='float' type='' href='S0007114525000443_figAb.png' src='http://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS0007114525000443/resource/name/S0007114525000443_figAb.png?pub-status=live'/></p></div><div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>The primary causes of female mortality often involve diseases related to oxidative stress. Dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) evaluates its antioxidant content and potential health effects. This study, registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024427784), explores the association between dietary TAC and women’s health outcomes, including endocrine conditions with gynaecological implications, obstetric outcomes, gynaecological conditions and oncological diseases related to the female reproductive system. We conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL for observational studies published up to February 2024 that explored the relationship between dietary TAC and these health conditions. Data were analysed using RevMan 5·4 software. Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria (sample sizes: 64–3209 women) and examined various conditions, including neoplasms (breast, endometrial and ovarian), bacterial vaginosis, menopause, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), pre-eclampsia (PE), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), miscarriage, infertility and inflammation and oxidative stress markers. The meta-analysis identified a significant association between dietary TAC, measured in vitamin C equivalents, and breast cancer, revealing that women with the disease had a lower dietary TAC due to reduced antioxidant intake. Mixed results were found for endometrial cancer, while higher TAC levels were associated with a lower risk of PCOS and infertility. Among postmenopausal women, higher TAC correlated with fewer symptoms such as sleep issues and anxiety. In gestational conditions, higher dietary TAC was linked to a lower risk of miscarriage, GDM and PE. Twelve of the nineteen studies demonstrated significant associations between dietary TAC and the outcomes of interest.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525000443?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525000443</dc:identifier><dc:title>Diet’s total antioxidant capacity and women’s health: systematic review and meta-analysis</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1404</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1417</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525000443</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525000443?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-03-06</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-03-06</dc:date><dc:creator>Dutra, Tauane A.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fragoso, Marilene B.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the Energy-Adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII) and anthropometric measurements, disease activity, inflammatory markers, and blood lipid concentrations in female patients with PSS. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2020 and November 2021, including 102 female patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PSS. Dietary intake was assessed using the multiple-pass, 3-day food record method to calculate E-DII scores. Physical activity was evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Short Form), anthropometric measurements were taken, and the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) was used to determine disease activity. Lipid profile and inflammatory markers were analyzed in blood samples. Patients had a median E-DII value of –2·36. An anti-inflammatory diet was associated with lower anthropometric measurements and reduced total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between E-DII and complement C3 (OR: 1·03, 95 % CI: 1·00, 1·05, <span class='italic'>P</span> = 0·021) and C4 (OR: 1·08, 95 % CI: 1·01, 1·13, <span class='italic'>P</span> = 0·019) after adjusting for age, disease score, drug use for SS, smoking, and physical activity. However, no significant correlation was found between E-DII and ESSDAI scores, C-reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In conclusion, a pro-inflammatory diet was associated with higher anthropometric measurements and adverse lipid profiles in PSS patients, but its relationship with disease activity and inflammation remains unclear.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103474?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525103474</dc:identifier><dc:title>Association of the energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index and Sjögren’s syndrome: a cross-sectional study</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1422</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1430</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525103474</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103474?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-06-03</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-06-03</dc:date><dc:creator>Karataş, Ezgi</dc:creator><dc:creator>Taştekin, Fatih</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yargucu Zihni, Figen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Barutçuoğlu, Burcu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Karabulut, Gonca</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711452510367X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Dietary choline and betaine intake in relation to psychological disorders in adults]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Dietary choline and betaine, suggested as neuroprotective nutrients, have not been sufficiently studied in relation to psychological disorders. This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary choline and betaine and common psychological disorders (depression, anxiety and psychological distress) among Iranian adults. Using a multistage cluster random sampling method, 533 middle-aged adults were included in this cross-sectional study. Dietary intakes were assessed using a validated semi-quantitative 168-item FFQ. Depression, anxiety and psychological distress were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the General Health Questionnaire, both validated for the Iranian population. Binary logistic regression was applied to explore the associations. Mean age of participants was 42·6 (<span class='sc'>sd</span> 11·14) years; of whom 18·9, 5·1 and 33·4 % had depression, anxiety and psychological distress, respectively. In the crude model, the highest intake of choline was negatively associated with depression (OR = 0·52; 95 % CI: 0·30, 0·91), anxiety (OR = 0·38; 95 % CI: 0·14, 0·99) and distress (OR = 0·60; 95 % CI: 0·38, 0·94) compared with the lowest intake. After considering all confounders, such associations remained significant in the case of depression (OR = 0·51; 95 % CI: 0·26, 0·98) but not for anxiety and distress. Additionally, there was no significant association between betaine intake and odds of depression, anxiety or distress in both crude and adjusted models. This study suggests a protective association between choline intake and depression, while no significant relation was found in the case of anxiety and distress. Betaine intake was not related to psychological disorders. Further prospective studies are crucial to replicate these findings.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711452510367X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S000711452510367X</dc:identifier><dc:title>Dietary choline and betaine intake in relation to psychological disorders in adults</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1431</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1438</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S000711452510367X</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711452510367X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-06-20</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-06-20</dc:date><dc:creator>Kazeminejad, Shervin</dc:creator><dc:creator>Moradmand, Zahra</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shahdadian, Farnaz</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hajhashemy, Zahra</dc:creator><dc:creator>Rouhani, Parisa</dc:creator><dc:creator>Saneei, Parvane</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103498?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Associations between diet quality indices and psoriasis severity: results from the Asking People with Psoriasis about Lifestyle and Eating (APPLE) cross-sectional study. – CORRIGENDUM]]></title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103498?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525103498</dc:identifier><dc:title>Associations between diet quality indices and psoriasis severity: results from the Asking People with Psoriasis about Lifestyle and Eating (APPLE) cross-sectional study. – CORRIGENDUM</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1439</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1447</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525103498</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103498?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-06-24</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-06-24</dc:date><dc:creator>Zanesco, Sylvia</dc:creator><dc:creator>Maruthappu, Thiviyani</dc:creator><dc:creator>Griffiths, Christopher E.M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dalrymple, Kathryn V.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gibson, Rachel</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hall, Wendy L.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525000911?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[How stable isotopes can advance nutrition assessments to inform sustainable food systems]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Global food security challenges, driven by the need to feed an estimated 10 billion people by 2050, require sustainable agricultural practices which strengthen nutritional adequacy while minimising environmental impacts. Yet, decision-making to foster food systems which consider both human and planetary health is growing in complexity. This paper, presented at an International Atomic Energy Agency-supported symposium at the 14th European Nutrition Conference of the Federation of European Nutrition Societies, highlights the potential of stable isotope techniques in generating valuable evidence to help support the development of sustainable food systems. It focuses on three methods: the dual tracer stable isotope technique for measuring protein digestibility, the Fe isotope dilution technique for assessing Fe absorption, loss and balance and the deuterium oxide dose-to-mother technique for estimating breast milk intake. The dual tracer isotope method provides a minimally invasive assessment of protein quality from a diverse variety of crops and novel sources, supporting the transition towards environmentally conscious, protein-rich diets. The Fe isotope dilution technique can be used to address Fe requirements across different population groups and calculate Fe absorption from whole diets or after consuming crops designed to be nutritionally sufficient, thus guiding dietary guidelines and agricultural strategies. Finally, the deuterium oxide dose-to-mother technique provides precise data on breast milk intake, underscoring the role of breastfeeding in sustaining optimal infant nutrition and the conservation of resources. These methods have the ability to generate critical evidence to support policy development and food system innovations that prioritise human health and environmental preservation.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525000911?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525000911</dc:identifier><dc:title>How stable isotopes can advance nutrition assessments to inform sustainable food systems</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1448</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1455</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525000911</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525000911?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-05-19</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-05-19</dc:date><dc:creator>Shertukde, Shruti P.</dc:creator><dc:creator>De Sévaux, Marieke A.J.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Herter-Aeberli, Isabelle</dc:creator><dc:creator>Preston, Tom</dc:creator><dc:creator>Loechl, Cornelia U.</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103541?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[In vitro fermentation potential of diet-derived fermentable proteins of thirty-one human foods]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Protein fermentation in the human gut is often associated with adverse health effects. Hence, understanding the fermentation characteristics of dietary undigested proteins is important for a comprehensive nutritional value of foods. This study investigated the protein fermentation kinetics of diet-derived proteins from thirty-one different foods using an <span class='italic'>in vitro</span> model and human faecal inoculum. The undigested diet-derived protein substrate originated from porcine ileal digesta obtained from assessment of the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) of the foods. Significant variations in fermentation kinetic parameters, particularly in maximum gas production rate (<span class='italic'>R</span><span class='sub'>max</span>) and time to reach cumulative gas production (GP) from the substrate (T<span class='sub'>GPs</span>), were observed. The R<span class='sub'>max</span> ranged from 15·5 (<span class='sc'>se</span> 0·7) ml/h for wheat bran-derived to 24·5 (<span class='sc'>se</span> 0·9) ml/h for oatmeal-derived proteins. Egg-derived proteins had the shortest T<span class='sub'>GPs</span> (14·7 (<span class='sc'>se</span> 0·7) h), while mushroom-derived proteins had the longest (27·6 (<span class='sc'>se</span> 7·1) h). When foods were categorised into five groups (‘animal protein’, ‘grains’, ‘legumes’, ‘fungi, algae and microorganisms’ and ‘others’), no significant differences were found in fermentation kinetics parameters. Samples were additionally incubated with porcine inoculum to assess potential donor-species effects. Human inoculum showed significantly lower R<span class='sub'>max</span>, cumulative GP and microbiota turnover than porcine inoculum, indicating reduced fermentative activity. Linear regression analysis revealed correlations between human and porcine-derived inoculum only for R<span class='sub'>max</span> (R<span class='sup'>2</span> = 0·78, <span class='italic'>P</span> &lt; 0·01) and T<span class='sub'>GPs</span> (R² = 0·17, <span class='italic'>P</span> &lt; 0·05). These findings underscore the importance of using human inoculum in <span class='italic'>in vitro</span> studies to better predict health implications of foods with DIAAS values.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103541?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525103541</dc:identifier><dc:title>In vitro fermentation potential of diet-derived fermentable proteins of thirty-one human foods</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1456</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1465</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525103541</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525103541?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-06-03</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-06-03</dc:date><dc:creator>Zhang, Hanlu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Cone, John W.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kies, Arie K.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hendriks, Wouter H.</dc:creator><dc:creator>van der Wielen, Nikkie</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711452500090X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[Brazilian front-of-package nutrition labelling and food additives: an approach to identify ultra-processed food products]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>This study aimed to explore combinations of the Brazilian front-of-package nutrition labelling (FoPNL) (high in added sugar, saturated fat or sodium) and/or three specific food additives with cosmetic functions (colourings, flavourings and non-sugar sweeteners) in packaged foods and beverages marketed in Brazil. This approach intends to strengthen the identification of ultra-processed food products (UPFP) by consumers through the information available on their labels. A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from the list of ingredients and the nutrition facts panel on labels of processed foods and UPFP available in Brazilian supermarkets between April and July 2017, totalling 8436 food items assessed, of which 84·0 % were UPFP. Of the total, 62·7 % of the UPFP would have the FoPNL and 65·1 %, 37·9 % and 12·9 % had flavouring, colouring and non-sugar sweeteners, respectively. Combining criteria for the FoPNL with any one of the three cosmetic additives analysed, 45·9 % of the UPFP were identified, and when considering the presence of the FoPNL, flavouring, colouring or non-sugar sweeteners, the identification increased to 89·9 %. Results showed that the current FoPNL in Brazil does not facilitate the identification of UPFP. In this sense, labels that indicate the presence of food additives with cosmetic functions (which are UPFP markers) could be a public health strategy to reduce the consumption of UPFP. Currently, food labelling regulations in Brazil are not aligned with Brazilian Dietary Guidelines recommendations.</p></div>]]></description><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711452500090X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S000711452500090X</dc:identifier><dc:title>Brazilian front-of-package nutrition labelling and food additives: an approach to identify ultra-processed food products</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1466</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>1472</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S000711452500090X</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711452500090X?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-05-19</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-05-19</dc:date><dc:creator>Canella, Daniela Silva</dc:creator><dc:creator>Martins, Ana Paula Bortoletto</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ribeiro, Mariana</dc:creator><dc:creator>Andrade, Giovanna Calixto</dc:creator><dc:creator>Montera, Vanessa dos Santos Pereira</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mais, Laís Amaral</dc:creator></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525104029?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[BJN volume 133 issue 11 Cover and Front matter]]></title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525104029?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525104029</dc:identifier><dc:title>BJN volume 133 issue 11 Cover and Front matter</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>2</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525104029</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525104029?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-07-25</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-07-25</dc:date></item><item rdf:about="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525104030?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss"><title><![CDATA[BJN volume 133 issue 11 Cover and Back matter]]></title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525104030?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><dc:identifier>doi:10.1017/S0007114525104030</dc:identifier><dc:title>BJN volume 133 issue 11 Cover and Back matter</dc:title><prism:startingPage>1</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage>2</prism:endingPage><prism:doi>10.1017/S0007114525104030</prism:doi><prism:url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114525104030?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</prism:url><prism:publicationDate>2025-07-25</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume></prism:volume><prism:number></prism:number><prism:publicationTitle>British Journal of Nutrition</prism:publicationTitle><dc:date>2025-07-25</dc:date></item></rdf:RDF>
