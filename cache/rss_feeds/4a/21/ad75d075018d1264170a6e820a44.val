										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Why the early gut microbiome matters</strong></h3>
<p>The gut microbiome begins forming at birth and <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/discover-how-your-gut-microbiota-evolves-during-your-lifespan-with-this-new-infographic/">evolves rapidly during infancy</a>, shaping the infant’s digestion, <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/clues-childhood-asthma-heightened-immune-responses-found-babys-gut-microbiome/">immunity,</a> and even brain development. Early microbial colonization is influenced by factors such as the mode of <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/does-exposing-cesarean-delivered-newborns-to-the-vaginal-microbiome-restore-microbiome-development/">delivery method</a>, feeding practices, the use of antimicrobials, and <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/could-fathers-gut-microbiome-affect-offsprings-health/">environmental exposures</a>.</p>
<p>Early colonizers like <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/the-first-1000-days-of-life-the-prominence-of-bifidobacteria-for-infants-gut-microbiota-development-and-later-health-outcomes/"><em>Bifidobacteria</em></a> thrive on <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/what-is-bifidobacterias-role-in-establishing-a-healthy-infant-gut-microbiome-and-immune-system/">breast milk</a>, while later microbes help process solid foods. Disruptions in this process have been linked to <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/can-the-baby-blues-affect-a-newborns-gut-microbiota/">allergies, metabolic disorders</a>, and <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/exploring-moms-stress-pregnancy-might-affect-childs-brain-development-depending-gut-microbiota/">neurodevelopmental conditions</a> later in life, making it essential to understand how a healthy microbiome matures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Common patterns across the globe</strong></h3>
<p>Until now, most studies have focused on small, localized cohorts, leaving gaps in our understanding of global patterns. <strong>In a </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56072-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>recent study</strong></a><strong>, scientists analyzed over 3,000 </strong>stool <strong>samples from </strong>infants 2-18 months of age across <strong>12 countries</strong> in Africa, Europe, Asia, and America<strong>, providing a comprehensive view of early microbiome development.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The study found that despite differences in diet and environment, infants worldwide show similar microbial succession trends</strong>. <em>Bifidobacterium spp.</em> dominate early infancy but decline as <em>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</em> and <em>Lachnospiraceae</em> bacteria increase—a shift tied to dietary changes like weaning. Microbial alpha diversity also increases with age, reflecting a more complex gut community despite significant socioeconomic and geographical differences.</p>
<p>Notably, <strong>these patterns were consistent across continents, </strong>including high- and low-income settings, <strong>suggesting universal developmental milestones.</strong> Functional analysis revealed that microbial genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism change predictably, aligning with transitions from milk to solid foods. For instance, shifts toward the intake of complex carbohydrates drive key age-related patterns in the infant gut microbiome, reflected by the rise of glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathway enzymes. This consistency highlights the robustness of these microbial &#8220;blueprints&#8221; for healthy gut maturation.</p>
<p>Complementary findings from other research groups have found an association between <strong>GABA concentrations in infant stool and specific behavioral traits </strong>during early infancy. Considering this and given the observed variation in the levels of a <strong><em>Bifidobacterium</em> enzyme linked to GABA production</strong> -a key neurotransmitter-, scientists proposed that further exploration of the<strong> role of <em>Bifidobacterium </em>in modulating GABA levels in infant stool</strong> might help to understand the influence of early gut microbiota on brain development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Limitations and future directions</strong></h3>
<p>While the study provides a global perspective, it didn’t account for factors like <strong>delivery mode, breastfeeding duration, or antibiotic use</strong>, which can influence microbiome development.</p>
<p>Importantly, understanding the functions of the gut microbiome is still limited because many microbial species, especially the understudied ones, are not yet fully mapped or characterized at the genome level. Additionally, this study focused solely on bacterial communities, without exploring the role of other gut inhabitants like <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/massive-yet-distinct-to-the-adult-diversity-of-the-infant-gut-virome/?search=virome"><strong>viruses</strong></a><strong>, fungi, or parasites </strong>in early-life gut microbiome development.</p>
<p><strong>Future research could integrate these variables to refine age-prediction models and explore how deviations from normative patterns affect health</strong>. Such tools might one day guide personalized nutrition or early interventions for at-risk infants, turning microbiome science into actionable <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/when-do-microbes-first-arrive-in-the-intestinal-tract-and-what-does-it-mean-for-a-newborns-health/">health strategies</a>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>
<p>This study lays the groundwork for detecting disruptions that could signal future health issues by identifying universal patterns of early microbiome development. <strong>Future research could focus on strategies to support optimal gut microbiota development, such as probiotic supplementation, targeted nutrition, and microbiome-friendly medical practices</strong>. As research continues, these insights may lead to microbiome-based guidelines for <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/digestive-disease-week-symposium-gut-microbiome-and-clinical-outcomes-in-pediatrics/">nurturing infant health</a>—proving that even the smallest microbes can have a big impact on lifelong well-being.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>After two decades of scientific exploration, the human microbiome has emerged as a critical determinant of health and disease. Fueled by multi-omics technologies and machine learning, the field has advanced from correlation-based observations to establishing causal relationships. This article presents recent and compelling examples of microbiome-based treatments that are ripe for clinical adoption and discusses challenges and opportunities facing the field based on expert interviews conducted by the GMFH team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, researchers have worked to decipher the complex ecology of the human microbiome. Decades of research and multi-omics have brought us to transition from correlation and observational studies to causation on <strong>microbiome-based therapies</strong>. However, we <strong>still lack a </strong><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/new-consensus-on-the-healthy-human-microbiome-concept/"><strong>consensus on what constitutes a &#8220;healthy&#8221; microbiome</strong></a><strong>. This reflects the complexity of the system and highlights the futility of a one-size-fits-all approach</strong>, due to confounding variables like diet, geography, age, sex, and lifestyle. Instead, clinicians and researchers are beginning to adopt a more nuanced view, using the microbiome in three main ways: as a mechanism, a metric, or a modifier.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a <strong>mechanism</strong>, the microbiome is studied for <strong>its causal role in health and disease</strong>. While the &#8220;chicken-or-egg&#8221; dilemma remains (whether changes in the microbiome cause or simply reflect disease), emerging technologies are increasingly capable of establishing causality.</li>
<li>As a <strong>metric</strong>, it offers <strong>diagnostic or prognostic value, predicting who is at risk</strong> or who might benefit from specific therapies.</li>
<li>As a <strong>modifier</strong>, it becomes a tool, manipulated through diet, probiotics, or microbial transplants to restore health thanks to <strong>targeted treatments.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This conceptual framework is not theoretical. It is already reshaping approaches to cancer immunotherapy, infection control, and neonatal care. However, the field still lacks clinical guidelines, validated tools, and regulatory clarity. A recent review in <em>Nature Medicine</em><sup>1</sup> outlines the current landscape, feasibility, and outstanding gaps in microbiome research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>From concept to clinic: five cases that reflect a field in transition</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Where does microbiome-based medicine stand today, and where is it headed? </strong>To illustrate these questions and reflect the subjects discussed in the publication in <em>Nature Medicine</em>, we present <strong>five simulated clinical cases, each featuring insights from the authors and experts</strong> <a href="https://jagilbert.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Jack Gilbert, PhD, microbial ecologist from University of California San Diego</a>, and <a href="https://www.whiteson.org/katrine/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Katrine Whiteson</a>, PhD, from the University of California Irvine. Their perspectives reveal a field in transition, moving from research promise to real-world application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>#1 Colorectal cancer prediction using gut microbiome </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. While colonoscopies remain the gold standard for screening, interest is growing in non-invasive tools such as microbiome-based stool testing<sup>2</sup> that could also be applied to inflammatory bowel diseases.<sup>3,4</sup></strong></p>
<p>According to Gilbert, such tools are beginning to show clinical utility, “<em>We have <strong>identified stool biomarkers that predict CRC recurrence<sup>5</sup></strong> after surgery. This enables early, proactive interventions that can accelerate recovery. For instance, <strong>a two-week dietary intervention can shift the microbiome to promote better post-operative outcomes</strong>.</em>” However, current stool tests lack the resolution of colonoscopies, particularly in detecting lesions in the upper colon. Their predictive power, while promising, remains inferior. “<em>Patients understandably want alternatives to invasive procedures,</em>” Whiteson added. “<em>Stool microbiome signatures can identify some polyp types, but <strong>we need more robust data before these tests can replace standard screening tools</strong>.</em>”</p>
<p>Where microbiome insights already hold clinical value is in <strong>supportive care</strong>. “<a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/fiber-and-cancer-prevention-what-science-says/"><strong><em>Dietary fiber</em></strong></a><strong><em>, for instance, can improve chemotherapy outcomes,</em></strong>” said Whiteson. “<em>This advice is not yet uniformly applied in clinical settings, but the evidence is strong. <strong>I often recommend patients start simple; even adding chia seeds to their daily routine</strong>.</em>” Gilbert shared a personal approach: “<em>Whenever I am scheduled for surgery, I make sure to eat very healthily for two to three weeks beforehand; 30 or more plant species per week, plenty of colourful fruits and vegetables, and a reduction in alcohol, refined sugars, and processed foods. I also spend more time in nature to </em><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/from-fighting-tumors-to-improving-longevity-how-gut-microbes-build-a-robust-immune-system/"><em>prepare my immune system and microbiome for optimal recovery</em></a><em>.</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>#2 Personalised nutrition interventions based on the microbiome to improve metabolic health</strong></h3>
<p><strong>With cardiometabolic diseases on the rise globally, the idea of tailoring diet to the gut microbiome is gaining momentum. But how close are we to realizing this vision?</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Personalized nutrition is coming</em>,” said Gilbert. “<em>Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered biomarker discovery, mucosal sampling, and engineered biosensors are driving rapid progress. We are seeing the <strong>emergence of &#8216;digital twin&#8217; models that predict individual responses to different diets</strong>.</em>” However, until these tools mature, the most effective advice remains behavioral: “<em>Eat a diverse, plant-rich diet and spend time outdoors. These habits consistently support a healthy gut microbiome</em>.”</p>
<p>Whiteson cautioned against over-reliance on direct-to-consumer microbiome testing services, “<em>There is currently </em><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/new-international-consensus-on-microbiome-testing-in-clinical-practice/"><strong><em>no strong evidence that these tests can accurately predict</em></strong></a><strong><em> individual metabolic risk or optimize diet in a clinically meaningful way.</em></strong><em> We need longitudinal datasets that track diet and stool over time to uncover useful patterns”. </em>In the meantime, public education is essential. “<em>At UC Irvine, <strong>we run a ‘teaching kitchen’ where chefs prepare meals while we explain their microbiome impact</strong></em>,” said Whiteson. “<em>It is practical and empowering. Hospitals should also lead by example and improve the nutritional quality of their own meals</em>.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>#3 Can probiotics and vaginal microbiota transfers boost vaginal health?</strong></h3>
<p>Microbiome based therapy are employed to maintain a healthy vaginal microbiome, protecting against sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections. A balanced microbial environment supports mucosal immunity and plays a critical role in fertility and pregnancy outcomes. However, disruptions to this ecosystem can lead to persistent conditions such as bacterial vaginosis.</p>
<p>Recurrent bacterial vaginosis <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/what-happens-in-the-gut-can-have-an-impact-on-the-vaginal-microbiota-now-scientists-understand-why/">remains difficult to treat</a>, often relapsing after antibiotic therapy. “<em>There is real therapeutic potential in targeting the vaginal microbiome</em>,” noted Whiteson. “<em>But unlike fecal microbiota transfers (FMTs), which are regulated and partly reimbursed, <strong>vaginal microbiome transplants remain experimental and carry risk</strong></em><strong>.</strong>” A lack of donor biobanks, safety protocols, and regulatory oversight continues to delay implementation. “<em>Many commercial vaginal probiotics contain strains that do not colonize effectively</em>,” Whiteson added. “<strong><em>There is no vaginal equivalent to gut-proven strains like Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG</em> and <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </em>CNCM I-745, among others</strong><em>.</em>” Until clinical evidence and infrastructure improve, dietary strategies remain a low-risk option: “<em>I often recommend diversifying the intake of fermented food as a familiar and affordable </em><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/fermented-foods-fleeting-fad-or-dietary-must-have/"><em>probiotic source</em></a><em>,</em>” said Whiteson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>#4 Probiotics in preterm infants</strong></h3>
<p>The early-life microbiome, particularly rich in <em>Bifidobacterium</em>, plays a crucial role in shaping immunity and reducing the risk of disease later in life. Current microbiome-based interventions aim to <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/maternal-fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-c-section-babies-can-restore-the-gut-microbiota-suggests-a-proof-of-concept-study/?search=c-section">mitigate the effects of C-section births</a> and promote beneficial colonization through breast milk or formulas enriched with components that mimic its properties, such as galacto-oligosaccharides, secretory IgA, and probiotics.</p>
<p>In preterm infants, early microbial colonization is critical. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis are highly prevalent among very preterm infants, and modulating the microbiome could reduce this risk. “<strong><em>Clinical trials such as EVIVO have shown that specific probiotic strains can reduce the incidence of NEC</em></strong>,” explained Whiteson. “<em>But these products are not yet standard due to regulatory hesitations—especially after isolated cases of sepsis.</em>” She believes timing and precision are key: “<em>We may not need prolonged courses; just a single, well-timed dose paired with breast milk or human milk oligosaccharides may suffice. It is about encouraging colonization without increasing the risk of sepsis</em>.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>#5 Advocating for phage therapy, probiotics, or fecal microbiota to tackle antibiotic-resistant infections</strong></h3>
<p>As antibiotic resistance escalates, alternatives like phage therapy and FMT are gaining traction. “<em>For recurrent Clostridioides difficile, FMT remains our best option,</em>” said Gilbert. “<strong><em>FDA-approved products like broad consortium of live microbes are available</em></strong><em>, but other applications remain experimental</em>”. Currently, trials are exploring other uses of FMT on non-communicable diseases such as graft-versus-host disease or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>Whiteson is cautiously <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/phage-therapy-provides-new-hope-for-refractory-and-resistant-bacterial-infections/">optimistic about phage therapy</a>: “<em>Recent FDA approvals (for conditions like sinusitis) are encouraging. But <strong>we still need clinical-grade phage libraries and clearer regulatory frameworks</strong></em><strong>.</strong>” Currently, phage cocktails are being tested on targeting <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> involved in cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>Ultimately, both experts agree that prevention begins with microbiome resilience. “<em>Feed it with fiber. Create an environment </em><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/clinical-validation-of-a-non-industrialized-microbiome-restore-diet/"><em>where beneficial microbes can thrive</em></a><em>,</em>” said  Whiteson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></h3>
<p>Microbiome-based care is moving from concept to clinic, but progress is slow. As Gilbert notes, “<em>Even when efficacy is clear, product development is long and costly. Oral microbiome therapeutics decade-plus journey and nine-figure price tag are not outliers</em>.” Safety concerns, such as donor screening or phage resistance, also demand stricter risk-benefit frameworks. To move forward, we need sustained investment in clinical studies and real-world testing, alongside deeper engagement with clinicians, hospital leaders, and public health professionals, to ensure these tools can be used safely and effectively in practice. <em>“I think we’ll need public-private partnerships and innovative funding models to support the development of more acute interventions as for instance, the antibiotic subscription schemes, promoting access to essential treatments while encouraging innovation. Similar models could help support the development of microbiome-based therapeutic&#8221; </em>said Whiteson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The human microbiome, particularly microbial communities living in our gut, has captured the interest of both scientists and the lay public due to its potential to change how nutrition and medical treatments work.</p>
<p>Patrick Veiga, PhD, Research Director of the MetaGenoPolis unit at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE), and gut microbiome expert, has just launched the novel <a href="https://missionmicrobiome.com/index.php/en/">“Mission: Microbiome – Metchnikoff’s Legacy”</a> in which <strong>science and suspense blend to digest the most relevant microbiome research findings in an easy-to-understand language</strong>. Joël Doré, PhD, Research Director at the INRAE and gut microbial ecologist, wrote the book&#8217;s prologue. The book is available in English, French, and will soon be released in Italian.</p>
<p>Through the lens of a story involving microbiologist Rafael Martins, who must save his wife Clara and the reputation of Professor Andrew Smith after falsified research result come to light, Veiga delves into the hidden work of cutting-edge microbiome research, from a blend of gut microorganisms administered in capsules to manage recurring <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infections to the discovery of a gene that acts like a satiety inhibitor that is highly abundant in the American microbiome and nearly absent in the Japanese. The setting is the fascinating city of Boston.</p>
<p>Regarding what inspired the author to write a science thriller about the microbiome, Veiga acknowledged to GMFH editors that: “today, a lot of people know what the gut microbiome is. But most still don’t realize how much it could change medicine and nutrition. More than 100 years ago, researchers like Metchnikoff were pioneers in studying the “gut flora.” As a legacy of their work, yogurt and fermented foods became part of our diets. And today, pharmacies are full of probiotics and prebiotics.</p>
<p>Now imagine the legacy of today’s research: next-generation probiotics, precision medicine, and personalized nutrition. That’s hope for better health. And this book is a message of that hope”.</p>
<p>Given the emerging role of gut microbes in health and disease, emerging research must be clearly communicated to help the non-expert audiences interpret findings accurately and make informed health choices. Beyond immersing the reader in the scientific thriller, Veiga also <strong>separates the wheat from the chaff, separating hype from real facts in the microbiome field</strong>. The format of a good story makes microbiome science more memorable, not only for the lay public but even for scientists. The end of the book includes relevant scientific references that support the statement in each chapter, so the curious reader can check the information presented throughout the book.</p>
<p>The book highlights that diet and lifestyle are the most studied tools available to care for our gut microbiome. Regarding diet, a high diversity of fibers and polyphenols is essential to nourish gut microbes. This implies eating a variety of whole grains, fruits, nuts, and pulses, and not only increasing the amount of these food staples. Fermented foods like yogurt also increase the diversity of gut microbes, and scientists are figuring out how they impact the gut and immune system.</p>
<p>Veiga states, “Science isn’t just for scientists. The microbiome is part of our story, our health, our diet. I hope this book sparks curiosity, conversation, and maybe even new habits!”.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>While the gut microbiome differs between patients with IBS and healthy controls, the precise mechanisms underlying the initial phase of microbial-host interactions are not fully understood.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) affect over 40% of children and adults and involve both gastrointestinal symptoms and altered brain function, including anxiety and depression as the most common psychiatric comorbidities. While <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/why-addressing-how-our-brain-and-our-gut-talk-to-each-other-matter-for-ibs/">the gut microbiome has been associated with their onset and development</a>, the mechanisms driving abnormal brain function in patients with DGBI are not fully understood, hindering the design of treatments that target the causes. It is well established that perturbation of gut microbiota in pregnant mothers or offspring after birth can predispose to dysfunction of the gut and brain, leading to the development of anxiety, depression, as well as digestive problems, later in life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159125000984?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New preclinical research</a> from McMaster University found that <strong>intestinal dendritic cells can migrate to the brain and influence behavior</strong>. The findings shed light on how changes in gut bacteria can alter brain function and behavior and suggest that an altered host-microbial crosstalk during the initial phase of microbial colonization may have long-term consequences.</p>
<p>To overcome the complexity of microbiota-brain communication and the large inter-variability in bacterial profiles in humans, the authors used gnotobiotic mouse models (i.e., mice born and raised in sterile conditions in which a defined microbial community is deliberately introduced) and a reductionist approach to examine how introducing gut bacteria affects brain function and behavior. They colonized germ-free mice and studied their behavior before and after colonization with a single bacterial strain of <em>Escherichia coli</em>, a simplified microbial community (Altered Schaedler Flora, consisting of 9 bacterial strains), and complex microbiota originating from conventional healthy mice.</p>
<p><strong>Germ-free mice behaved differently from conventional mice </strong>(i.e., born and raised in the presence of normal microbiota),<strong> displaying more exploratory behavior and being less cautious. Still, germ-free mice’s behavior and brain chemistry normalized within 2 weeks after bacterial colonization</strong>. Interestingly, this occurred when the mice were colonized with complex or simplified microbiota, or even a single bacterial strain. The altered behavior driven by transient or persistent bacterial colonization was accompanied by changes in the brain, including expression of neurotrophin BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) -it is a marker of neural plasticity- and neural activity marker c-fos -it is often used as a marker of neuronal activation- in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are areas associated with control of emotions and learning.</p>
<p>The researchers found that <strong>intestinal dendritic cells, activated through the cell membrane located toll-like receptor (TLR) or intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) signaling, are crucial for establishing normal behavior after initial bacterial colonization</strong>. Further, they discovered that these specialized immune cells migrate from the gut, some of them transporting bacterial fragments, into the brain. <strong>Blocking the activation and/or migration of the intestinal dendritic cells prevented changes in behavior after bacterial colonization</strong>. Interestingly, using genetically modified bacteria that only transiently colonized the murine intestine, the study showed that gut bacteria are no longer needed to sustain the altered behaviour once the immune system is activated and behavioral changes occur.</p>
<p>These pre-clinical findings demonstrate that the innate immune system, but not T and B lymphocytes, is associated with activation of neuro-immune networks in the gut and the brain after bacterial colonization. They may also reveal why there is a rise in psychiatric diseases and disorders of gut-brain communication, such as IBS, laying the foundation for novel therapeutic targets. The described mechanisms of microbiome-gut-brain communication with activation and migration of intestinal immune cells to the brain might also occur in adulthood during infectious gastroenteritis, which might explain the development of psychiatric comorbidities in many of these patients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every surface of our body, from the lungs to the bladder, has a unique makeup of microorganisms. The vast microbial diversity is primarily found in the digestive tract, which is crucial to good gut health, but also conditions that may not appear to be connected to your gut, including cardiovascular health, skin problems, and neurological diseases, among others. While what we know so far on the link between gut microbiota and other organs comes from studying gut bacteria, but others like fungi, yeast, viruses, and parasites are also joining the party.</p>
<p>One of the most studied areas is the connection between the gut and the brain. <strong>Microbes in your gut are constantly </strong><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/feed-your-microbes-to-improve-gut-and-mental-health/"><strong>talking with your brain</strong></a><strong>, contributing to stress and our emotions, but the converse is also possible</strong>. In addition to microbes, the gut-brain connection involves the vagus nerve, hormones, immune cells, and metabolites, all of which work as a team to allow the two-way street between the gut and brain.</p>
<p>The implications of these findings suggest that the microbiome may play a role in the development of dementia, autism, and other disorders. However, we still do not know whether an altered microbiome is the cause of brain disorders or merely a consequence.</p>
<p><strong>Gut microbes might also be a hidden cause of difficult-to-control lung diseases</strong>. It turns out that the gut microbiota is connected to the lung microbiota, the latter being primarily shaped by the oropharynx microbiome, which varies among individuals but remains stable over time. Scientists are exploring how to leverage commensal microbes in the lung <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/what-if-your-gut-microbiota-is-linked-to-respiratory-health/">to predict asthmatic flares and improve response to current drugs for lung diseases</a>. Some studies have also suggested that a plant-based diet is essential for keeping inflammation at bay and providing the necessary nutrients to <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/researchers-turn-to-the-gut-lung-connection-in-the-search-for-a-treatment-for-covid-19/">support the immune system and gut microbiome</a>, which are relevant to respiratory health.</p>
<p>The gut is an entrance door to our body, and gut microbiota helps the immune system create a barrier against pathogens. Up to 80% of the immune cells are located in the gut. <strong>Seeking a cure for irritable bowel syndrome, researchers have turned to </strong><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/why-do-gastrointestinal-symptoms-follow-a-meal-clues-are-emerging/"><strong>the increased activation of immune defenses in the small intestine</strong></a>. These findings support that gastro-intestinal problems are not in patients’ heads.</p>
<p>The high fermentation of carbohydrates in the large intestine is not the only culprit of symptoms, as scientists theorize that an abdominal infection can temporarily alter the gut barrier. With the barrier disturbed, some food components can get absorbed and trigger localized allergic reactions. However, it is too early to recommend IgG-based elimination diets for patients with IBS who use exclusion diets for symptom management.</p>
<p>Close to the gut, the liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of food. In healthy individuals, the liver acts as a gatekeeper, removing toxic compounds before they enter the bloodstream. <strong>When the gut barrier is disturbed, microorganisms and their metabolites can enter the liver</strong>. Scientists are exploring new ways to modulate the gut and liver <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/diving-into-how-the-gut-and-the-liver-talk-to-each-other/">to mitigate the complications of liver diseases</a>.</p>
<p>The skin is one of the most extensive surfaces of the body and is also connected to what happens in our gut. But unlike the gut microbiome, the skin microbiome is more independent. The connection between the gut and the skin was initially introduced in 2016. Recent studies have shown that an imbalanced gut microbiome can weaken the intestinal wall, a condition already <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/the-gut-skin-axis-feel-it-in-your-gut-wear-it-on-your-skin/">linked to eczema, psoriasis, vitiligo, and acne</a>.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the study of heart health through the lens of gut microbes can help understand why not everyone’s metabolism responds the same way to diet. Scientists and physicians are beginning to recognize elevated blood levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)- a compound derived from diet (e.g., choline, carnitine) and the microbiome- as a marker that can be used to identify patients at higher risk of heart disease. Scientists are seeking new targeted treatments that inhibit the conversion of dietary compounds to TMAO <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/the-gut-heart-axis-how-the-gut-microbiota-impacts-cardiovascular-health/">by modulating the gut microbiome</a> and utilizing individual gut microbiome profiles to personalize dietary advice.</p>

<p><strong>The educational content in this post, elaborated in collaboration with <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/funding/">Lesaffre</a>, was independently developed and approved by the GMFH publishing team and editorial board.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>How is gut microbiome linked to reproductive tract health? </strong></h3>
<p>Endometriosis is a common gynecological estrogen-dependent inflammatory disorder that affects approximately 10% of women in reproductive age. It can go unnoticed for several years before the onset of the symptoms, which include impaired reproductive function, psychological changes, and pain in the reproductive system or adjacent to it. For instance, up to 23% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms that can overlap with those of <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/why-addressing-how-our-brain-and-our-gut-talk-to-each-other-matter-for-ibs/?search=Lesaffre">irritable bowel syndrome</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Both conditions can cause abdominal pain, cramping, and diarrhea, with women with endometriosis having a threefold increased risk of developing IBS (</strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9357916/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>)</strong>.</p>
<p>One hypothesis that explains the development of this disease includes frequent retrograde menstruation, common in around 80% of women, which can evolve into endometriosis in the presence of multifactorial dysregulation. This includes the <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/what-happens-in-the-gut-can-have-an-impact-on-the-vaginal-microbiota-now-scientists-understand-why/">reproductive and gut microbiota interaction</a> as well as immunological, metabolic, genetic, and hormonal factors.</p>

<h3><strong>Endometriosis: cause or consequence of gut microbiome dysbiosis?</strong></h3>
<p>This pathological condition was first characterized by hormonal dysregulation. Further assessments showed the presence of damage-associated molecular patterns (endogenous signals released with the damage, such as DNA) in endometrial cell fragments shed during menstruation. These patterns trigger inflammation to promote the removal of these fragments, but in persistent immune stimuli, it promotes endometrium implantation and growth.</p>
<p>In endometriosis, chronic inflammatory signals have been correlated with increased circulating estrogens and bacterial dysbiosis in the gut and reproductive system. Indeed, the hygiene hypothesis suggests reduced commensal microbial diversity could be behind the higher prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as endometriosis, in high-income countries.</p>
<p>Several studies in animal models and humans have shed new light on the gut microbiome and endometriosis interactions, but the cause-consequence directionality is still unclear. Some of the changes associated with endometriosis include reduced <em>Lactobacillus,</em> higher opportunistic pathogens in the reproductive tract microbiome, and reduced <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> and increased <em>Firmicutes</em> in the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The bidirectional interaction between these two microbiotas and the gut-immune-brain axis is becoming increasingly clear. This altered composition of both microbiomes can alter the immune state and the intestinal barrier integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher abundance of<strong> pathogenic bacteria</strong> <strong>causes a chronic inflammatory</strong> response that contributes to the endometriosis pathogenesis, as shown in mice, rhesus macaques, and humans. For instance, antibiotic treatment helps to reduce symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Gut dysbiosis may increase </strong><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/dr-patrice-cani-vicious-cycle-gut-permeability-inflammation/?search=gut%20permeability"><strong>gut permeability</strong></a> through disruption of tight junctions, relevant in the permeability of intestinal epithelial cells in humans, allowing harmful substances to enter the bloodstream, leading to a chronic inflammatory state.</li>
<li><strong>Estrogen regulation </strong>by the genes encoding enzymes capable of metabolizing estrogens in the gut microbiota, known as <strong>estrobolome</strong>. For example, increased β-glucoronidase-producing bacteria, such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>, generate more circulating estrogens in women.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, a research group from Guangzhou (China) showed that the predictive value of gut microbiota in endometriosis may be more important than vaginal microbiota. For instance, researchers are analyzing <em>Ruminococcus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em>, present in intestinal and peritoneal fluids, as potential biomarkers for diagnosis of endometriosis.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Can dietary interventions complement the treatment of endometriosis? </strong></h3>
<p>Considering the increasing evidence of the gut and reproductive health connection, non-pharmacological interventions have emerged as a promising <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/can-probiotics-aid-in-treating-bacterial-vaginosis-and-vulvovaginal-candidiasis/?search=Lesaffre">complement to medical treatments for diseases such as bacterial vaginosis or vulvovaginal candidiasis</a>. For this, researchers have analyzed the diet of women with endometriosis and the impact of dietary changes on symptoms or disease regression.</p>
<p>Some of the first attempts include studies that only compared symptoms before and after the intervention:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gluten-free diet</strong>: only 50% of the 295 patients reported improvement in painful symptoms, and 30% withdrew due to side effects (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23334113/">here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Low nickel diet</strong> to assess the prevalence of Ni-allergic contact mucositis in patients with endometriosis. This study showed that 90% of the 31 patients experienced a reduction in the intensity of gastrointestinal symptoms after 3 months (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/2/341">here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>editerranean diet</strong> has been related to the reduction in general pain and an improvement in the overall condition of over 50% of the women on the study after 5 months (<a href="https://www.jarlife.net/download.html?type=pdf&amp;id=74">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the lack of properly controlled groups limits the impact of these results. To overcome this limitation, controlled studies have analyzed the effect of other nutrition-based interventions, including antioxidants, <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/can-probiotics-have-anti-inflammatory-effects-worth-considering-in-chronic-intestinal-diseases/?search=chronic%20inflammation">probiotics</a>, vitamins ( B6, A, C, E), mineral salts, fiber intake, dairy products, and many more. For instance, in some of these studies scientists observed a decrease in oxidative stress markers and pain symptoms. Nevertheless, the diversity of endometriosis patients and the complexity of dietary interventions still limit the extraction of practical outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers have given particular attention to diets <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/the-low-fodmap-diet-can-pose-challenges-for-people-with-ibs-what-can-be-done-to-minimize-some-of-those-challenges-in-clinical-practice/?search=gluten-free%20diet">low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (<strong>FODMAPs</strong>)</a> due to their role in intestinal luminal distension and, thus, gut motility and pain. Some studies have evaluated this diet in women with endometriosis within a group of patients with gastrointestinal disorders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 2017, Moore et al. </strong>showed that 72% of the 59 patients with endometriosis and IBS saw an improvement in symptoms over 50% after 4 weeks (<a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajo.12594">here</a>).</li>
<li>At the DDW 2024 Congress,<strong> Varney et al. </strong>showed preliminary results from a single blind crossover feeding trial of low FODMAP diet vs Australian diet in women aged 18 to menopause with endometriosis and poorly controlled gastrointestinal symptoms: up to 70% of the patients exhibited a reduction in the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms compared to 32% in participants following Australian diet (<a href="https://ddw.digitellinc.com/p/s/efficacy-of-the-low-fodmap-diet-for-gastrointestinal-symptoms-associated-with-endometriosis-a-randomised-controlled-trial-5827">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, several dietary studies on endometriosis have found a positive effect, but some patients experienced side effects such as abdominal symptoms. Additionally, the high heterogeneity of the interventions and measured outcomes results in a moderate or high-risk bias, limiting the validity of the results.</p>
<p>To ensure the safety, effectiveness, and clear definition of consensus guidelines, further clinical trials must evaluate their potential, among others, to relieve endometriosis-associated pain, decrease endometriotic lesion size, and prevent disease pathogenesis or recurrence.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Take-home messages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The gut microbiota is linked to reproductive tract health through the gut-reproductive tract axis.</li>
<li>Recent studies show a higher predictive value of gut microbiota in endometriosis diagnosis than that of the vaginal microbiota.</li>
<li>Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis and endometriosis.</li>
<li>The potential use of probiotics and other dietary interventions, such as the low nickel diet, could be explored as complementary treatments for endometriosis.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Science continues to show that the gut plays a <strong>key role in health</strong>. This became even clearer during the <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/washington-2025-thirteenth-edition/program/"><strong>13th GMFH World Summit</strong></a>, held on <strong>March 15–16, 2025</strong>, in <strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> The event brought together healthcare professionals from around the world to discuss the theme — <strong>Microbiome Milieu: Diet, Drugs and Environment</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights from the four plenary sessions and thematic workshops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Could gut microbes make you skinnier or heavier?</strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever considered that what you eat doesn’t just affect you, but also the microorganisms living inside you? This idea set the stage for the Summit, which began with an <strong>inspiring keynote lecture</strong> showing how our <strong>diet can influence not only our metabolism but also the gut microbiota</strong>.</p>
<p>This perspective was brought by <strong>Dr. Karine Clément</strong>, who presented the <strong>NutriOmics approach</strong>, integrating data on <strong>nutrition, metabolism, and gut microbiota</strong>. She showed that <strong>simple lifestyle habits</strong>—such as a <strong>varied diet</strong>, <strong>regular exercise</strong>, and <strong>avoiding smoking</strong>—can positively influence both <strong>metabolic health</strong> and <strong>microbial diversity</strong>. Dr. Clément and her team identified that individuals with <strong>lower microbial diversity</strong> tend to have a <strong>less healthy metabolism</strong>, but that <strong>dietary changes</strong> were able to improve this scenario.</p>
<p>In the future, <strong>advanced tools like omics sciences</strong> may help to <strong>personalize prevention and treatment strategies for obesity</strong>, considering the <strong>unique profile of each individual</strong>. For example, people with obesity have a lower abundance of <em>Akkermansia</em>, <em>Faecalibacterium,</em> and butyrate production potential, while having higher trimethylamine production potential, the latter being a gut microbiota-derived metabolite produced from dietary nutrients. Changes at the level of microbiota explain the significant variability between individuals in current obesity treatments and may offer clues to better selecting individuals who will benefit from pharmacological and dietary treatments, while also helping to integrate microbiome-targeted treatments as an add-on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What we eat can help — or harm — our gut health</strong></h3>
<p>The first plenary session of the <strong>GMFH Summit 2025</strong> brought together three experts who shared <strong>complementary perspectives</strong> on how <strong>diet and the gut microbiota</strong> can influence health — for better or worse.</p>
<p>Dr. Ashwin Ananthakrishnan opened the session by showing that <strong>our food choices can increase or reduce the risk of various diseases</strong>, since different components of the <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/clinical-validation-of-a-non-industrialized-microbiome-restore-diet/">diet can directly impact the <strong>composition of the gut microbiota</strong></a> and, consequently, our health.</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Abigail Johnson offered a practical reflection on the <strong>methodological rigor needed to advance in this field</strong>. She pointed out that everything starts with a clear question: <strong>what do we want to discover?</strong> From there, it’s possible to define the right tools to collect dietary data and understand how this information can be combined with data on the gut microbiota. Johnson also acknowledged the current limitations of nutrition and microbiome research. Numerous nutrients that are not quantified on a food label (e.g., polyphenols found in most plant-based foods) can improve host health by feeding the gut microbiota, and scientists have begun considering how the type of food, cooking methods, and background diet affect gut microbes.</p>
<p>Wrapping up the session, Dr. Benoit Chassaing presented a study that caught the audience’s attention by showing the first study to show that <strong>reducing the consumption of food additives — especially emulsifiers, commonly found in ultra-processed foods — can help relieve symptoms of mild-to-moderately active </strong><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/glossary/crohns-disease/"><strong>Crohn’s disease</strong></a>. Findings in mice also showed that dietary emulsifiers can make it easier for certain intestinal bacteria to cross the intestinal barrier, increasing their potential to damage gut health. A clear message stood out: <strong>small changes in what we eat can have a big impact on gut health!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Beyond the gut: new clues into the relationship between the gut microbiota, cholesterol, and brain health</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that your gut influences much more than just digestion? The second plenary session of the <strong>GMFH Summit 2025</strong> delivered a clear message: <strong>the impacts of the gut microbiota go far beyond the intestine</strong>.</p>
<p>Dr. Bernd Schnabl presented surprising findings about a condition called <strong>auto-brewery syndrome</strong> — a rare situation in which the gut microbiota produces large amounts of alcohol, even without alcohol consumption, contributing to <strong>liver disease</strong>. He pointed out that the imbalance of these microorganisms can be treated in the near future with <strong>fecal microbiota transplantation</strong>, bringing hope to patients facing this diagnosis.</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Chenhao Li showed that certain gut bacteria, such as those from the <em><strong>Oscillibacter</strong></em> genus, are linked to <strong>cardiovascular risk factors</strong>, potentially affecting <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/new-clues-into-how-gut-microbes-help-regulate-cholesterol-and-fat-metabolism/"><strong>cholesterol metabolism</strong></a> and the <strong>balance of lipids</strong> in the body. It is interesting to note that cholesterol can be converted to coprostanol by the gut microbiota, and the presence of bacteria encoding the gene involved in this conversion is linked to lower levels of stool and blood cholesterol.</p>
<p>To close the session, Dr. Andrea Merchak highlighted a connection we don’t always consider in our day-to-day lives — <strong>the link between the gut and the brain.</strong> She explained that <strong>inflammation in the gut can directly impact brain health</strong> and may be associated with the development of <strong>neurodegenerative diseases</strong>. Key players involved in the <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/feed-your-microbes-to-improve-gut-and-mental-health/">gut-brain communication</a> shaping the risk of brain inflammation and neurodegeneration are bile acids and gut inflammation. And she left an important message: our well-being doesn’t depend on a single factor, but rather on <strong>everything we are exposed to every day</strong> — diet, environment, lifestyle. According to Dr. Merchak, to fully understand these connections and turn knowledge into concrete actions, <strong>it is essential to invest in </strong><strong>collaborative science</strong><strong>, bringing together different fields to develop </strong><strong>prevention and treatment strategies</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How to improve gut health? Why one-size-fits-all approaches don’t work</strong></h3>
<p>The afternoon of the first day of the <strong>GMFH Summit 2025</strong> was dedicated to a series of <strong>thematic workshops</strong>, offering participants the opportunity to delve deeper into specific discussions about <strong>diet, gut microbiota, and health</strong>. In the first workshop, the speakers addressed how <strong>nutritional recommendations can be tailored</strong> according to each person’s health status. The second workshop introduced innovative perspectives by presenting <strong>new tools for studying the microbiome</strong>.</p>
<p>The third session focused on a very current question: <strong>Should we consume more </strong><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/is-dietary-fiber-beneficial-or-deleterious-for-patients-with-ibd/"><strong>fiber</strong></a><strong> or less?</strong> The answer, as always in science, is that it depends. Fiber that comes from foods is the first choice and it seems prudent to increase the variety of non-processed plant foods to favour the growth of different bacteria. However, there is no one-size-fits-all diet advice, as the host’s health, immune status, diet, and gut microbiota have a significant impact on the final effect of fiber on health. Inulin can nourish gut bacteria, while psyllium and wheat fibers impact gut microbiota composition without promoting microbiota growth. Speakers also discussed how different dietary patterns can lead to <strong>distinct and stable states of the gut microbiota</strong>. Finally, the fourth workshop was dedicated to <strong>early life</strong>, exploring the ins and outs of <strong>probiotic administration to reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and death in preterm infants</strong>.</p>
<p>The sessions provided a more <strong>exclusive space for knowledge exchange</strong> among researchers, healthcare professionals, and students interested in understanding how scientific findings can be applied <strong>in everyday practice</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The gut ecosystem: more than just bacteria</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bacteria aren’t the whole story! </strong>On the second day, the third plenary session expanded the discussion to include the <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/massive-yet-distinct-to-the-adult-diversity-of-the-infant-gut-virome"><strong>virome</strong></a> (the set of viruses in the gut), <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/the-fascinating-world-of-gut-fungi-and-its-relevance-for-health/"><strong>fungi</strong></a>, and the interaction between <strong>bacteriophages and bacteria</strong>.</p>
<p>The challenges of using <strong>bacteriophages therapeutically</strong> — viruses that infect bacteria — as an alternative to antibiotics, were discussed by Robert Schooley. He explained that, despite their <strong>promising potential</strong>, there are still many barriers to applying this strategy in practice, such as the <strong>difficulty in predicting their effectiveness</strong>, the need to <strong>protect them against stomach acid</strong>, and the risk of <strong>bacteria developing resistance to phages</strong> over time.</p>
<p>Dr. Kyla Ost then brought attention to a lesser-known component of the gut microbiome: <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/the-fascinating-world-of-gut-fungi-and-its-relevance-for-health/">fungi</a>. She highlighted that, although they represent only <strong>1 to 2% of the microbiota</strong>, <strong><em>Candida</em></strong><strong> species</strong> play an important role in <strong>regulating the immune system</strong>. When in balance, they may contribute to <strong>metabolic health and promote beneficial immune responses</strong>, but when out of balance and in the form of hyphae (long, narrow, and tube-like filaments, they can promote <strong>inflammation and disease</strong>.</p>
<p>The presentations reinforced that, to fully understand the impact of the microbiome on health, it is essential to look <strong>beyond bacteria</strong> and consider <strong>viruses and fungi</strong>, underscoring the idea that <strong>gut health depends on a complex and interconnected ecosystem</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The gut microbiome and oncology</strong></h3>
<p>The fourth plenary session of the event focused on the interactions between the <strong>gut </strong><a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/fiber-and-cancer-prevention-what-science-says/"><strong>microbiota and oncology</strong></a>. Dr. Jonathan Peled discussed different strategies that can be used to <strong>modulate the microbiota during cancer therapies</strong>, such as the use of <strong>antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics</strong>, with the goal of improving treatment response and reducing side effects.</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Carrie Daniel-MacDougall emphasized the role of <strong>diet as a tool to support microbiota health</strong>, highlighting that a <strong>varied diet rich in prebiotic foods</strong> can help maintain <strong>microbial balance</strong> and promote <strong>symbiotic relationships</strong> between beneficial microorganisms. Diet is one of the most researched factors known to shape cancer risk and treatment outcomes through influencing the gut microbiota. Danie-MacDougall presented recent findings on how incorporating navy beans into the diet of colorectal cancer survivors may improve gut health and regulate immune and inflammatory processes. Ongoing human clinical trials are exploring how delivering prepared meals high in fiber to metastatic melanoma patients on immunotherapy may shape treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>Also in this plenary session, Dr. Cynthia Sears presented data on the presence of <strong>bacterial biofilms</strong> in cases of <strong>colorectal cancer</strong>. Dr. Sears showed that these structures are more frequent in <strong>tumors located in the right side of the colon</strong> and may contribute to cancer development by <strong>compromising the intestinal barrier</strong> and <strong>activating inflammatory pathways</strong>. The researcher also discussed possible mechanisms by which oral <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-effects-of-antibiotics-on-the-gut-microbiome-and-how-to-recover-after-taking-them/">antibiotics</a> and the bacterium <strong><em>Clostridioides difficile</em></strong> may be associated with colon cancer, reinforcing the importance of understanding the role of the microbiota in the <strong>prevention and treatment of this disease</strong>.</p>
<p>Closing the session, Dr. KC Huang presented <strong>new tools to investigate how gut bacteria colonize the body and interact with the environment</strong>. Dr. Huang highlighted that technologies such as <strong>metagenomic sequencing</strong> and <strong>bacterial lineage tracking</strong> allow these interactions to be monitored in detail, paving the way for increasingly precise discoveries about the impact of the gut microbiota on health.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>The sessions left us with a powerful reminder:</strong></h3>
<p>The GMFH Summit 2025 made it clear that the <strong>gut microbiota is shaped daily by our choices</strong><strong>: what we eat, the medications we use, and the environment we live in</strong>. These factors not only impact <strong>gut health,</strong> but also influence <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/tag/gut-microbiome-organ-axes/"><strong>connections with different organs and systems throughout the body</strong>.</a></p>
<p>Science is advancing to turn these discoveries into <strong>practical recommendations</strong>, reaffirming that <strong>taking care of the gut is taking care of overall health</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The educational content in this post, elaborated in collaboration with <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bromatech</a>, was independently developed and approved by the GMFH publishing team and editorial board.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Besides diet and exercise, gut microbes could contribute to making you thin</strong></h3>
<p>Diet and exercise remain the first interventions for weight loss, but variability response between individuals is observed and it’s common that most people end up regaining the weight they lost within two years. The gut ecosystem could partially explain this and emerging evidence suggests that targeting the gut could help to move forward. One of the theories on the roots of obesity, with evidence from both mice and humans, incorporates the gut microbiota and inflammation<sup>1,2</sup>.</p>
<p>In recent years, scientists have explored how our tiny microbes living in the gut contribute to our metabolism and body weight regulation. Initial findings showed that germ-free mice present a reduction in body fat whereas mice receiving the microbiota of an obese twin increased their body weight more than the mice receiving that of a lean twin and this was not explained by the number of calories in the mice diet. That said such findings are not always consistently confirmed and “resetting” the gut microbiota through fecal microbiota transfer in patients who undergo bariatric surgery does not appear to affect weight loss<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In reference to the challenge in defining a healthy gut microbiota, research revealed no consistent gut microbiota differences between lean people and people with obesity<sup>4 </sup>and no clear role of the early-life gut microbiota towards risk of obesity in later life<sup>5</sup>. However, it turns out that gut microbiota is involved in metabolic health, such as blood glucose control and food intake behavior, explaining why not all people lose weight when they change their lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>New clues into how gut bacteria control your food preferences</strong></h3>
<p>Scientists have suggested that an imbalanced gut microbiome composition and metabolites are causally involved in inappropriate food behaviors, including alterations in palatable food preferences and food-seeking behavior observed in obesity <sup>6,7</sup>. A new study adds preliminary evidence for the idea that gut microbes could affect food behaviors through shaping the dopamine neurotransmission in brain areas involved in food reward<sup>8,9</sup>. A mechanistic hypothesis includes gut microbes-mediated activation of neuroinflammation since high-fat diet feeding increases plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component found in the outer membrane of some bacteria, leading to inflammation including in the brain. The researchers showed that such bacterial component can trigger food-reward dysregulation when it reaches the brain which ultimately results in alterations of preference towards palatable food and food-seeking behaviors<sup>8</sup>.</p>
<p>What is also interesting is that receptors in the lining of the gut modulate the levels of a key microbial metabolite, ultimately influencing the brain’s sugar preference. It turned out that, in mouse models and people, intestinal free fatty acid receptor 4 (Ffar4) regulates the abundance of <em>Bacteroides vulgatus</em>, which produces the metabolite pantothenate (pantothenic acid or vitamin B5) that induces secretion of the hormones GLP1 in the gut and FGF21 in the liver, which act on the hypothalamus to reduce sugar intake. Interestingly, the levels of <em>B. vulgatus </em>are decreased in diabetic mice and humans. As GLP-1 alone did not affect sugar preference and the liver production of FGF21 hormone was a mandatory step, these findings highlight that the brain-gut connection is not solely involved but also a gut-liver-brain axis<sup>10</sup>. <strong>These findings suggest that gut bacteria can drive sugar cravings, leading to the increased consumption of sugary foods, which is seen in obesity.</strong></p>
<p>In line with these findings, previous research in mice also revealed that other gut microbial species (e.g., <em>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</em> and <em>Bacteroides uniformis</em>) or their metabolites can reduce overfeeding<sup>11,12</sup>. <strong>This supports that overconsumption could be modulated by the gut microbiome</strong><sup>13</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>People with obesity-related disorders may benefit from gut microbiota-targeted dietary interventions</strong></h3>
<p>While the first intervention to tackle obesity is a healthy diet and sufficient exercise, <strong>recent human studies suggest that people suffering from obesity may benefit from dietary and supplemental interventions that specifically act on the microbiome</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Lactobacillus </em></strong><strong>and <em>Bifidobacterium</em>-containing probiotics</strong>: <em>Lactobacillus</em> species have been the most studied probiotics for obesity, and the beneficial effects of such probiotics on body weight and body fat in overweight individuals seem to be strain dependent<sup>14</sup>. Several studies have demonstrated that supplementation with <em>Bifidobacterium breve</em> B-3 in individuals with a BMI between 25 and 30 over a 12-week period led to a reduction in fat mass and waist circumference, as well as an increase in serum HDL levels<sup>15,16</sup>. Moreover, two studies conducted by the Autonomous University of Madrid investigated the synergistic effects of a hypocaloric Mediterranean-type diet combined with the administration of a probiotic mixture composed of <em>Bifidobacterium breve</em> B-3, <em>Lactobacillus plantarum</em> LP-115, and <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em> LA14 in patients with class I obesity (30&lt;BMI&lt;34.9), compared to diet alone. Results indicated that the intervention group experienced a statistically significant reduction in anthropometric and blood parameters associated with cardiovascular risk, as well as a significant increase in bacterial species inversely associated with overweight and/or obesity, such as <em>Bifidobacterium</em>, <em>Faecalibacterium</em> spp., and <em>Akkermansia muciniphila</em><sup>17,18</sup>.</li>
<li><strong>Next-generation beneficial microbes</strong>: bacteria with promising benefits for weight loss and glycaemic control include <em>Akkermansia muciniphila</em>, <em>Hafnia alvei</em>HA4597<sup>TM</sup> and <em>Eubacterium hallii</em><sup>19</sup>. The main mechanisms of action involved include a restoration of gut barrier and an improvement in insulin sensitivity, a reduction in total cholesterol, and decrease of several markers of inflammation and liver dysfunction. The potential benefits of Hafnia alvei seems to involve the synthesis of a protein capable to modulate perception of satiety at the brain level<sup>20,21</sup>.</li>
<li><strong>Type 2 resistant-starch prebiotic fiber</strong>: consuming 40 g per day of prebiotic resistant starch over 8 weeks led to lower body weight, lower visceral fat mass, lower lipid absorption (as supported by an increased fecal lipid content), and an enrichment of <em>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</em>, which is a primary degrader of resistant starch, as compared to a non-prebiotic control starch<sup>22</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond boosting beneficial gut commensals and strengthening the gut barrier, some additional dietetic advice may help manage weight. A study, of more than 100,000 people, supports <strong>a diet providing primarily plant-based foods, unprocessed foods, with a moderate intake of animal-based foods, is associated with healthy ageing without chronic cardiovascular diseases</strong><sup>23</sup>. Intermittent fasting, especially time-restricted eating, was also effective for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity<sup>24</sup>.</p>
<p>It also seems reasonable to reduce marketing campaigns that boost unhealthy food. In this context, it seems prudent to limit artificial sweeteners and sugar-sweetened foods as much as possible, even in individuals who are physically active<sup>25</sup>. This recommendation is based on <strong>recent findings in mice and humans showing that sugar and some artificial sweeteners may trigger inflammation and are linked with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes</strong><sup>25-27</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Takeaway</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>While diet and exercise remain the go-to interventions for weight loss, an appropriate modulation of the gut microbiome could also help in weight management.</li>
<li>Gut bacteria can drive sugar cravings, leading to the increased consumption of sugary foods seen in obesity.</li>
<li>While the first treatment for obesity is a healthy diet and sufficient exercise, some probiotics and novel beneficial microbes and resistant-starch prebiotic fibers could help tackle excessive weight.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Cutting-edge research and practical applications of microbiome-based nutritional therapies</strong></h3>
<p>The satellite symposium “Diet, nutrition, and gut microbiome” that preceded the 13<sup>th</sup> annual GMFH World Summit focused on the role of nutrition in shaping health outcomes by impacting the gut microbiome. Janelle Smith, registered dietitian (RD), updated how disordered eating may affect the gut microbiome through impacting neuroinflammation and gut permeability, antibodies to appetite hormones, and metabolism-altering microbes. While introducing food slowly to minimize uncomfortable digestive symptoms and including diverse dietary sources of prebiotics and resistant starch is key, Smith acknowledged the importance of addressing the potential adverse psychosocial effects of controlling diet during eating disorders recovery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diet is the main factor driving gut microbiome composition, but only partly explains gut microbiome adaptations. However, available dietary assessment tools designed for use in research (i.e., food frequency questionnaires, food record tools, and 24-hour dietary recall tools) ignore dietary “dark matter,” including nutrients such as phytochemicals that impact the microbiome but are not quantified in food labels. Abigail Johnson, RD, acknowledged that microbiome nutrition studies should collect information about food ingredients (e.g., emulsifiers, colors), type of cooking, probiotic content of foods, how foods are grown (e.g., organic/conventional), foods unique to different cultural eating traditions, and how foods are packaged as all of them are potential confounders explaining authentic microbiome-health relationships. Last, Tamara Freuman, Master of Science (MS) degree, RD, Certified Dietitian-Nutritionist (CDN), shared practical strategies and insights for healthcare professionals to guide patients in translating dietary recommendations into sustainable, long-term behavior changes that support digestive health.</p>

<h3><strong>Emulsifiers, fermented foods, prebiotics, and digestive and metabolic health</strong></h3>
<p>Research must adopt a systems approach focused on microbiome-host interactions in connected ecosystems to understand microbiome impacts better and leverage microbial functions. Karine Clément, MD PhD, full professor of nutrition at Pitié Salpêtrière hospital and Sorbonne Université in Paris, updated the crosstalk between microbiome alterations and derived metabolites found in obesity based on a systems approach. New unpublished findings from the Nutriomics study found that predicting weight loss response with GLP1 analogues and physical exercise is possible when stratifying participants by microbiome gene richness, which opens the potential role of incorporating gut microbiome information for disease stratification, biomarkers, or add-on therapy.</p>
<p>Diet-driven effects on the microbiome may partly explain the current rise in obesity and related metabolic conditions. Food additives ubiquitous in modern diets are in the spotlight due to their potential involvement in the onset and development of non-communicable diseases. However, the extent of food additives’ impact varies among individuals. Benoit Chassaing, PhD, from Institut Pasteur, presented <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/74/5/761"><em>in vitro</em> findings</a> showing that the sensitivity to dietary emulsifier carboxymethylcellulose of fecal samples can be predicted by specific metagenomic signatures. For instance, bacteria including <em>Adlercreutzia equolifaciens</em> and <em>Frisingicoccus caecimuris</em> correlated positively with intestinal inflammation. Further research is needed to probe the potential of the fecal microbiome to predict dietary emulsifier sensitivity in the context of healthy individuals and those with gastrointestinal conditions. Chassaing also presented the first clinical trial to show that a low emulsifier diet is a safe and effective intervention for mild-to-moderately active Crohn’s disease, reducing clinical symptoms and fecal calprotectin.</p>

<p>Maria Marco, PhD, from the University of California Davis, updated new findings on the mechanisms of action of dairy- and vegetable-origin fermented foods that have been widely used as food staples for centuries. Human studies (mainly on fermented dairy) indicate that fermented foods can improve digestive health. Marco presented new findings that fermented cabbage can affect intestinal barrier function, and these effects may vary based on fermentation time, the presence of a probiotic inoculant, and homemade versus commercial process methodology.</p>

<p>Not all prebiotic fibers impact the gut microbiome and host similarly. Andrew Gewirtz, PhD, MD, from Georgia State University, presented findings in mice showing that the benefits of fiber-rich foods are not recapitulated by supplemental fiber. Prebiotic fibers, such as inulin, can nourish gut bacteria and may provide benefits similar to dietary fiber. Still, they are not without risk, as inulin-enriched diets induced hepatocellular carcinoma in 10% of mice. Other fibers, such as psyllium and wheat bran, have shown benefits in mice in restoring the colonic microbiota depleted by a low-fiber diet and reducing the severity of diet-induced obesity, respectively.</p>

<h3><strong>Non-bacterial clues to gastrointestinal and liver diseases</strong></h3>
<p>Although less studied than bacteria, other key microorganisms are present in the gut, including viruses, phages, yeast, and fungi. These microorganisms, which shape host physiology and the activity of the gut microbes, are the focus of emerging research and may be as important as bacteria. Robert Schooley, MD, PhD, from the University of California, San Diego, covered the role of bacteriophages as a promising approach to the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01759-y">reducing Escherichia coli load</a> that may cause fatal <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/73/7/1257/6270940">bloodstream infections in hematological cancer patients</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1742-x">reducing mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis</a>, among others. These findings are significant considering that no fundamentally new antibiotics have been discovered for 20 years. Limitations of phages include the narrow host range of phages, uncertain predictive value of <em>in vitro</em> phage susceptibility testing, the acid lability of most phages requiring strategies to mitigate inactivation by gastric acid, development of phage resistance during therapy, major knowledge gaps related to phage pharmacology, and development of adaptive immune responses to phages during therapy.</p>

<p>Kyla Ost, PhD, from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, focused on virulence factors of yeast and fungi in the gut that make up 1-2% of the microbiome biomass. Beneficial and pathogenic yeast and fungi species are the same, so it is not a good idea to simplify their classification into “good” and “bad”. For instance, <em>Candida</em> species dominate and are immunomodulatory. Some <em>Candida</em> species stimulate adaptive and innate immune responses during homeostasis that promote metabolic health and boost immune surveillance. It is known that early-life colonization with <em>Candida dubliniensis </em><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn0953">promotes metabolic health</a>. In contrast, host extrinsic (e.g., diet, antibiotics) and intrinsic (e.g, age, anti-microbial peptides such as peptide YY) factors may boost fungal dysbiosis associated with decreased bacterial diversity and intestinal inflammation. Therefore, immune interactions regulate <em>Candida</em> morphology (hyphae-associated effectors from <em>Candida </em>exacerbate pathogenic inflammation) and virulence factor expression in the gut (pathogenic potential varies between <em>Candida </em>strains).</p>

<h3><strong>Extra-intestinal implications of gut microbiome manipulation</strong></h3>
<p>Diet is an overlooked intervention for cancer prevention and treatment outcomes, shaping the gut microbiome. Carrie Daniel-MacDougall, PhD, MPH, from the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, presented ongoing and published clinical trials on the role of diet in shaping cancer treatment outcomes through supporting the gut microbiome. The <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00439-5/fulltext">Be GONE Trial</a> found adding ½ cup of cooked, canned navy beans to the usual diet over a 2-week ramp-up period, followed by 1 cup per day for an additional 6 weeks, was a safe, scalable dietary strategy to favorably modulate the gut microbiome of patients with obesity and a history of colorectal cancer and/or polyps. Unpublished data from the Diet and Immune Effects Trial (DIET) and Prebiotic Food Enriched Diet (PreFED) trials showed that a high fiber (30-50 g/d) versus a control fiber diet (20 g/d) is associated with a favourable immune checkpoint blockade response in patients with metastatic melanoma on immunotherapy.</p>

<p>Jonathan Peled, MD, explored associations with foods and fecal microbiome diversity in immunotherapy patients. Microbiome diversity declines in a regimen-specific fashion in adults undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), and some diet components are associated with the outcome of fecal microbiome diversity. Unpublished data showed that low fecal diversity was most strongly associated with foods rich in simple sugars in the prior two days, and the effect was additive to antibiotics. Of note, dietary sucrose exacerbated antibiotic-induced <em>Enterococcus</em> expansion, an effect that was not explained simply by a reduction in fiber intake. These findings suggest that avoiding sugar intake while on antibiotics is a possible way to mitigate <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-effects-of-antibiotics-on-the-gut-microbiome-and-how-to-recover-after-taking-them/">antibiotic-induced dysbiosis</a>. Peled shared that rationally designed probiotics (e.g., SER-155, an oral investigational cultivated microbiome therapeutic comprised of 16 bacterial <em>Firmicutes</em> strains) are probably better than commercially available probiotics in improving microbial (e.g., gut domination by pathobionts) and health outcomes (e.g., bloodstream infections) in adults undergoing allo-HCT.</p>

<p>Cynthia Sears, MD, at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, updated novel mechanisms for colon carcinogenesis involving the role of polymicrobial bacterial biofilms. What is interesting to note is that <em>Clostridioides difficile </em>toxins have been shown to promote biofilm invasion deep into colonic crypts in mice and humans, highlighting a potential way to tackle early onset colorectal cancer. Enterotoxigenic <em>Bacteroides fragilis </em>(ETBF) has been linked to inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer and it turned out that its pro-inflammatory and tumorigenic functions are driven by the <em>B. fragilis</em> toxin gene it possesses. While not everyone with ETBF on their colon will develop cancerous lesions, preliminary findings suggest that stress and antibiotic use may disrupt the gut microbiome and make ETBF more likely to induce inflammation.</p>
<p>Last, Andrea Merchak, PhD, from the University of Florida (USA), gave an overview of the mechanisms of gut-brain communication. Preliminary clinical work suggests the role of bile acid metabolism in multiple sclerosis and gut inflammation in dementia. However, there are limited microbiome-based interventions ready to use for tackling brain inflammation and neurodegeneration in the clinical setting.</p>
