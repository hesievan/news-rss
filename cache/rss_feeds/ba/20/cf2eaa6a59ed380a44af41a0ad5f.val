			<title>People with eating disorders say cannabis and psychedelics help more than antidepressants</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250724040940.htm</link>
			<description>A massive global survey has revealed that people with eating disorders often turn to cannabis and psychedelics like magic mushrooms and LSD to ease their symptoms, rating them more effective than traditional medications. Surprisingly, common prescriptions like antidepressants were seen as helpful for overall mental health but fell short for eating disorder relief.</description>

			<title>Study finds tummy-tuck patients still shedding pounds five years later</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250706230325.htm</link>
			<description>Patients who undergo tummy tuck surgery may be in for more than just cosmetic changes — a new study shows they often keep losing weight for years after the procedure. Researchers followed 188 patients and found consistent weight reduction up to five years later, especially in those with higher initial BMIs. Interestingly, lifestyle improvements, such as better diet and exercise habits, may play a key role in this surprising long-term effect. This could mean tummy tucks aren&#039;t just sculpting bodies — they may be reshaping lives.</description>

			<title>Fitness trackers are failing millions — this fix could change everything</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250620030423.htm</link>
			<description>Fitness trackers often fail people with obesity by underestimating their energy burn, leading to discouraging results and misguided health data. A scientist&#039;s frustrating experience in an exercise class with his mother-in-law where her effort wasn t reflected on the fitness leaderboard sparked a breakthrough. His team at Northwestern developed a new open-source smartwatch algorithm that accurately captures energy expenditure for individuals with obesity, rivaling gold-standard lab equipment and paving the way for more inclusive, empowering health tracking.</description>

			<title>Self-esteem skyrockets 131% after weight-loss surgery, study reveals</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250620030326.htm</link>
			<description>Self-esteem scores jumped a remarkable 131% within just one year of bariatric surgery, according to a large study presented at ASMBS 2025. Tracking nearly 5,800 patients, researchers found a direct link between weight loss and rising confidence, with the greatest psychological boosts seen in those who lost the most weight. Despite differences in gender, race, or procedure type, patients across the board reported profound improvements in self-worth. The findings shine a spotlight on how addressing weight stigma through surgery can dramatically reshape not just bodies but minds.</description>

			<title>99 trials later, fasting ties traditional diets in weight-loss showdown</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250619090901.htm</link>
			<description>Intermittent fasting might not be a miracle solution, but it stands shoulder to shoulder with traditional calorie-cutting when it comes to shedding pounds and improving metabolic health. A major new analysis reveals that alternate day fasting may have a slight edge, yet none of the methods alone reached clinically meaningful thresholds for weight loss.</description>

			<title>Brain food fight: Rutgers maps the hidden switch that turns cravings on and off</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250614034230.htm</link>
			<description>Rutgers scientists have uncovered a tug-of-war inside the brain between hunger and satiety, revealing two newly mapped neural circuits that battle over when to eat and when to stop. These findings offer an unprecedented glimpse into how hormones and brain signals interact, with implications for fine-tuning today&#039;s weight-loss drugs like Ozempic.</description>

			<title>Beyond Ozempic: New weight loss drug rivals surgery</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250612081323.htm</link>
			<description>Tufts University scientists are aiming to revolutionize the future of weight loss drugs by engineering a new compound that targets four gut hormones instead of the usual one to three. These next-gen tetra-functional peptides may overcome the limitations of current drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro especially their nausea, muscle loss, and rebound weight gain.</description>

			<title>The hunger switch in your nose: How smells tell your brain to stop eating</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250612031553.htm</link>
			<description>A team of scientists has discovered a direct link between the smell of food and feelings of fullness at least in lean mice. This brain circuit, located in the medial septum and triggered by food odors, helps animals eat less by making them feel satiated even before taking a bite. But intriguingly, obese mice lacked this response, highlighting how excess weight may interfere with this satiety mechanism. The finding could have major implications for how we think about the role of smell in appetite and offer new strategies to combat overeating.</description>

			<title>Scientists found the brain glitch that makes you think you’re still hungry</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611084115.htm</link>
			<description>A team of scientists has identified specialized neurons in the brain that store &quot;meal memories&quot; detailed recollections of when and what we eat. These engrams, found in the ventral hippocampus, help regulate eating behavior by communicating with hunger-related areas of the brain. When these memory traces are impaired due to distraction, brain injury, or memory disorders individuals are more likely to overeat because they can&#039;t recall recent meals. The research not only uncovers a critical neural mechanism but also suggests new strategies for treating obesity by enhancing memory around food consumption.</description>

			<title>Newly identified group of nerve cells in the brain regulates bodyweight</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250528132243.htm</link>
			<description>Obesity is a global health problem that affects many people. In recent years, very promising anti-obesity drugs have been developed. Despite these successes, there are patients who do not respond to these drugs or suffer from side effects. Therefore, there is still an unmet need for therapies. Researchers have now discovered a small group of nerve cells in the hypothalamus of mouse brains that influence eating behavior and weight gain. This discovery could pave the way for the development of new targeted anti-obesity drugs.</description>

			<title>Waist-to-height ratio predicts heart failure incidence</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250519132009.htm</link>
			<description>Risk of heart failure (HF) has been shown to increase as body mass index (BMI) increases; however, BMI has limitations as an obesity measure. Over median follow-up of 13 years, waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) was found to significantly predict incident HF in almost 2,000 individuals in the Malm Preventive Project. WtHR may be a better metric than BMI to identify patients with HF who could benefit from targeted obesity interventions.</description>

			<title>A healthy diet in childhood is linked to starting menstrual periods later, regardless of BMI or height</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250506224424.htm</link>
			<description>Eating a healthy diet as a child is linked to girls having their first menstrual period at an older age than those who consumed a less healthy diet, according to a new study. The findings remained unaltered by the girls&#039; body mass index or height, both of which have been associated with the earlier onset of periods. The study has implications for health in later life as it is well known that women who started their periods at an early age may be at higher risk for diabetes, obesity, breast cancer and diseases of the heart and blood vessels.</description>

			<title>Early mutations and risk factors for stomach cancer, and develops a pre-cancer model for stomach cancer prevention</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250416135743.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers have made significant advancements in understanding the earliest stages of stomach cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, through two recent innovative studies. With a prevalence rates particularly high in East Asia, including China, this cancer often stems from chronic inflammation caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, which affects approximately 15% of the Hong Kong population. This inflammation can lead to a pre-cancerous stage known as intestinal metaplasia. The innovative studies have uncovered crucial insights into the earliest changes in the stomach that contribute to the development of stomach cancer, laying the foundation for improved prevention and early detection, ultimately saving lives.</description>

			<title>Scientists discover why obesity takes away the pleasure of eating</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/03/250326122652.htm</link>
			<description>Many obese people report losing pleasure in eating rich foods -- something also seen in obese mice. Scientists have now discovered the reason. Long-term high-fat diets lower levels of neurotensin in the brain, disrupting the dopamine pleasure network and decreasing the desire to eat high-fat foods. Raising neurotensin levels in mice brings back the pleasure and aids weight loss. Bringing back the pleasure could help people break the habit of overeating.</description>

			<title>Slowing down to eat less: Towards simple strategies for obesity prevention</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/03/250325115253.htm</link>
			<description>Obesity prevention strategies often focus on diet, but eating behaviors also play a key role. In a recent study, researchers from Japan investigated factors influencing meal duration, including sex differences, chewing patterns, and rhythmic cues. Their findings suggest that eating more slowly -- by increasing chews per bite or using slow rhythmic cues -- may help reduce food intake. These insights could inform practical, low-cost obesity prevention strategies by promoting slower eating habits in daily life.</description>

			<title>Biologists discover ancient neurohormone that controls appetite</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/03/250324152427.htm</link>
			<description>Biologists have discovered that bombesin, a neurohormone controlling appetite in humans, also regulates feeding in starfish, revealing its ancient evolutionary origin dating back over 500 million years. The study not only sheds light on the deep evolutionary roots of appetite regulation but also suggests potential applications for managing starfish invasions in shellfish farms impacted by climate change. Alongside weight-loss inducing drugs, compounds that mimic the action of bombesin are in development for treatment of obesity.</description>

			<title>Exercise and healthy eating behavior together provide the best protection against cardiovascular diseases</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/03/250305134942.htm</link>
			<description>Researchers have found that women who exhibit disturbed eating behaviors and engage in low physical activity tend to have more central body fat and a higher risk of metabolic low-grade inflammation. This condition increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, which become more prevalent after menopause. However, the combined effect of exercise and healthy eating behavior offers the most effective protection against inflammation and may also reduce it after menopause.</description>

			<title>Genetic evidence that diabetes drug GLP-1 receptor agonists achieve weight loss primarily by reducing fat mass more than muscle</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250224111937.htm</link>
			<description>Diabetes and obesity have become pressing health issues worldwide. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, a class of medications widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), have shown significant effectiveness in both lowering blood sugar levels and aiding weight loss due to their unique pharmacological mechanisms. A research team assessed the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist in weight loss through genetic studies, aiming to understand whether the use of these medications reduces weight due to muscle or fat mass loss. This genetic study revealed that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce weight by reducing more fat mass than muscle mass.</description>

			<description>People with pockets of fat hidden inside their muscles are at a higher risk of dying or being hospitalized from a heart attack or heart failure, regardless of their body mass index, according to new research. This &#039;intermuscular&#039; fat is highly prized in beef steaks for cooking. However, little is known about this type of body fat in humans, and its impact on health. This is the first study to comprehensively investigate the effects of fatty muscles on heart disease. The new finding adds evidence that existing measures, such as body mass index or waist circumference, are not adequate to evaluate the risk of heart disease accurately for all people.</description>
