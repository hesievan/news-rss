      <description>Food as Medicine (FAM) interventions are emerging as an effective approach to addressing nutrition security and chronic disease among patients with nutrition-related disease or risk-factors. FAM programs are food-based interventions provided simultaneously with medical nutrition therapy that reaffirm the role food and nutrition play in health outcomes. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) is taking bold steps to promote registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN) as a requisite of rigorous FAM programming capable of transforming health and improving well-being.</description>

      <description>According to recommendations, adolescents should limit caffeine intake to 100 milligrams (mg) per day. High schools (but not middle or elementary schools) participating in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program are allowed to sell beverages with added caffeine to students, but the amount of caffeine is not regulated. The prevalence of caffeinated beverages sold to students, and the amount of caffeine these beverages contain, is unknown.</description>

      <description>It is the consensus of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that equitable access to nutrition care, including medical nutrition therapy provided or facilitated by registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs), can improve nutrition and health outcomes for older adults in long-term care and community settings. The target audience includes RDNs, policymakers, insurance providers, and other interested parties. The consensus statement is based on the Evidence Analysis Center’s malnutrition in older adults systematic reviews that evaluated nutrition assessment and nutrition interventions, and the expertise of content experts.</description>

      <description>Internalized weight bias (IWB) is the application of negative stereotypes about people in larger bodies to oneself. IWB is associated with numerous negative physical and mental health outcomes, including increased risk of disordered eating. It is possible that this relationship is explained in part by pressure to achieve a so-called ideal body, due to the preponderance of the pro-thin and anti-fat bias often perpetuated in Western media content (ie, appearance pressure from the media).</description>

      <description>Data from real-world medical nutrition therapy (MNT)—delivered by registered dietitian nutritionists—is needed to understand the influence of MNT on patient outcomes and support public policy regarding reimbursement of MNT services. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics developed a web-based registry to collect nutrition care data and track MNT-related outcomes. This platform is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Health Informatics Infrastructure. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Health Informatics Infrastructure is a tool that uses the Nutrition Care Process and Terminology to investigate nutrition care practices and resulting outcomes.</description>

      <description>On average, humans swallow about 600 times daily without effort or thought; however, swallowing is a complex mechanism requiring intricate coordination of several muscles in the oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus innervated by several pairs of cranial nerves. Any loss of neural control or muscle coordination in any part of the swallowing process may result in swallowing difficulty or dysphagia.</description>

      <description>The Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) developed the Essential Practice Competencies1 for CDR-credentialed nutrition and dietetics practitioners to provide overarching validated standards for 2 credentials—registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) and nutrition and dietetic technician, registered (NDTR).2 Practice competencies define the knowledge, skill, judgment, and attitude requirements throughout a practitioner’s career, across practice areas, and within focus areas. Competencies provide a structured guide to help identify, evaluate, and develop the behaviors required for continuing competence.</description>

      <description>Recently, emerging population-based evidence has revealed that yoga practitioners are particularly vulnerable to engaging in disordered eating behaviors, inclusive of orthorexia symptoms (OS). Although orthorexia tends to be characterized by a hypervigilance over consuming so-called healthy or clean foods based on quality attributes, its associations with variables related to broader diet culture (eg, internalized weight bias [IWB] and body- and fitness-related shame, guilt, and hubristic pride) remain underexamined.</description>

      <description>An estimated 1.5% of the adult population and 1.4% of youth ages 13 through 17 identify as transgender in the United States.1 Transgender patients are poorly served by the current health care system. Findings from the United States Transgender Survey showed that 1 in 3 (33.0%) transgender adults who sought medical care in the past year had negative experiences such as having to teach their provider about transgender health care (24%), being asked invasive questions about being transgender unrelated to the visit (15%), or being refused health care related to their transition (8%).</description>

      <description>Sociocultural risk factors predict disordered eating and body dissatisfaction. Three internalized variables (self-objectification, thin-ideal internalization, and internalized weight stigma) have each been shown to relate to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Although these 3 variables have distinct conceptualizations and definitions, they show similarity in theoretical definitions, evidence of strong relationships between the 3 variables, and similarity in how they each relate to adverse health outcomes.</description>

      <description>Federal child nutrition programs are a key part of the nutrition safety net, but cost serves as a key participation barrier for students. This can also lead to meal debt for schools when students are unable to pay for the meals they take. The US Department of Agriculture Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) seeks to address these challenges by providing free meals to all students within lower-income schools or school districts. Whereas pandemic-related waivers provided universal school meals nationwide, once the waivers expired, states were again confronted with meal participation barriers.</description>

      <title>Prevalence of Functional Food Use for Self-Reported Type 2 Diabetes Management in a Cohort of Hispanic Adults: Results of an Online Survey</title>
      <link>https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(25)00054-1/fulltext?rss=yes</link>
      <description>Hispanic adults are disproportionately diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and are more likely to use functional foods for T2DM management compared with non-Hispanic White adults. Functional foods contain biologically active ingredients associated with physiological health benefits for preventing and managing chronic disease. Understanding which functional foods are used for T2DM management among Hispanic adults is essential for planning interventions.</description>

      <link>https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(25)00038-3/fulltext?rss=yes</link>
      <description>Fruit drinks are the top source of added sugar in young children’s diets, increasing their risk of chronic disease. It is unclear to what extent front-of-package marketing and disclosures influence parents’ perceptions of fruit drinks and their intentions and decisions to purchase them. These data are needed to inform regulatory and legal action to reduce potentially misleading marketing and help parents make healthier choices for their children.</description>

      <description>The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides benefits redeemable for select healthy foods, aligned with the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, to support healthy diets among pregnant and postpartum women, and their children to age 5 years, living in low-income households. WIC benefits are often not fully redeemed, limiting nutritional benefits of participation.</description>

      <description>Two facets of positive body image, body appreciation and functionality appreciation, are positively associated with an adaptive eating style known as intuitive eating. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the association between positive body image and intuitive eating, although it is well established that weight bias internalization is associated with unfavorable views of the self and body and interferes with health behavior engagement.</description>

      <description>In the United States, a means-tested approach is often used to provide free or reduced-price meals (FRPM) to students from lower-income households. However, federal income thresholds do not account for regional cost of living variations. Thus, many ineligible households may be at risk for food insecurity. Universal free school meal (UFSM) policies may help address this issue, especially in states with a higher cost of living.</description>
